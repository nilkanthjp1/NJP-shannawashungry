<p>I’ve always thought that pear with chocolate is an underrated combination. This cake brings them both together in the most <em>delicious</em> way. Soft, spiced pears enveloped in a dark chocolatey sponge cake. <em>So</em> good. And vegan if you use dairy-free milk &amp; vegan sugars.</p>
{% capture ingredients %}
2 pears (Boscs works very well for poaching) - peeled and the base trimmed to allow them to stand upright
½ cup sugar
2 cinnamon sticks
4 cloves
6 cardamom pods

1½ cups self-raising flour
½ cup caster sugar or extra-fine granulated sugar
¼ cup cocoa
1½ tsp baking powder
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
¼ tsp salt
1 tbsp vinegar 
½ cup oil (canola or sunflower work best)
¾ cup warm milk (dairy or plant-based)
3 tbsp golden syrup or maple syrup
{% endcapture %}
{% capture method %}
<ol>
<li>Begin by poaching the pears: place the pears in a saucepan and cover with water.</li>
<li>Add the sugar and spices and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down and let the pears simmer for 25 minutes. Remove them from the liquid, and let them cool.</li>
<li>Preheat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius or 350 Fahrenheit.</li>
<li>Line a loaf tin with baking parchment</li>
<li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt.</li>
<li>Add the vinegar and swiftly follow with the warm milk, golden syrup and oil.</li>
<li>Mix well until you have a smooth chocolatey cake batter.</li>
<li>Place the poached pears in the loaf tin. Follow with the cake mixture.</li>
<li>Bake the loaf for approximately 30 minutes, until the top has cracked slightly and bounces back if gently pressed. (A skewer test in this situation isn't wise because the pears are at the very centre of the cake)</li>
<li>Allow the cake to cool in its tin before removing. Dust with icing (powdered) sugar before serving.</li>
</ol>
