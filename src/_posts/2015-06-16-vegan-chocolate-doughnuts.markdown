<p>These doughnuts are surprisingly simple to make. I’m not a fan of deep frying, but these really are worth the effort/calories! If you aren’t vegan, you can substitute the vegan cream for heavy whipping cream and the vegan shortening for butter.</p>
{% capture ingredients %}
Yield: 12 small doughnuts

2 tbsp granulated sugar
3/4 tsp active dry yeast
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp sea salt
1/4 cup dairy-free cream
1 tbsp vegan shortening/spread 
1/2 cup vegan bittersweet chocolate chips
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon 
2 cups neutral oil for frying, such as sunflower or canola
{% endcapture %}
{% capture method %}
<ol>
<li>Combine the yeast and sugar with 1/2 cup of warm water and leave to one side for 10 minutes, until the yeast has begun to foam.</li>
<li>While you wait, measure out the flour, salt and baking powder in a mixing bowl and stir to combine.</li>
<li>In a small saucepan on a low heat, warm the vegan cream and spread until the spread has just melted, then remove from the heat.</li>
<li>Add the cream mixture to the flour mixture and stir until just combined.</li>
<li>Add the yeast mixture to bowl and combine until a dough begins to form.</li>
<li>Knead the dough for a couple of minutes until smooth.</li>
<li>Place the dough in a greased bowl. Cover with cling film and leave in a warm place to rise for 45 minutes.</li>
<li>Once the dough has risen, divide it into 12 equal sized dough balls.</li>
<li>To make a doughnut, flatten one dough ball in the palm of your hand, add approximately 8 chocolate chips to the centre of the ball, then pinch the edges together to seal. Continue for the remaining 11.</li>
<li>Heat your fryer on a low to medium heat. You don't want the oil to smoke, so keep an eye on it.</li>
<li>While it heats, prepare your powdered sugar by sifting it and mixing in the cinnamon powder. Prepare a plate covered with absorbent kitchen paper for the fried doughnuts.</li>
<li>To test if your oil is at the right temperature for frying, place a tiny piece of dough in the oil if it bubbles and stays at the surface, it's ready.</li>
<li>Once your oil is hot enough, fry your doughnuts, 3 at a time. Let them cook for at least 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown. The outside colour of the doughnut can be deceiving - if they don't cook long enough, you'll be left with raw dough inside.</li>
<li>Once cooked, lay them on the kitchen paper for a minute.</li>
<li>Toss the doughnuts in the powdered sugar and cinnamon and serve immediately</li>
</ol>
