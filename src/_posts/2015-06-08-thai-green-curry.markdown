<p>I am a HUGE fan of Thai food but always struggle to find restaurants that will make it fresh, without fish sauce or shrimp paste. Because shallots and garlic are so crucial to the authentic Thai green curry, it’s near impossible to find a restaurant that will prepare the dish without alliums for you. You can stop looking now though, because this recipe will more than satisfy a hankering for a Thai green curry!</p>
<p>Unlike restaurant versions, this curry is light and tastes clean. The herbs make a beautifully fragrant and flavourful sauce. It departs from the ordinary because it doesn’t taste or feel at all greasy. It’s actually quite pleasant to eat on its own too!</p>
<p>The recipe is easily adaptable in terms of the vegetables you use – snow peas, green beans, peas, sweet potato, mushrooms and broccoli all work well. The beauty of this curry is that you can throw it together quickly with most vegetables that you have at home.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how traditional cashews are in a curry like this, but they do add great texture and flavour.</p>
<p>The paste is enough for a large curry serving 6 people, so you <em>could</em> half it, BUT I highly recommend freezing half of it for another day.</p>
<p>Most of the ingredients are easy to get your hands on – lemongrass is widely available in Asian supermarkets. I found it at Whole Foods.</p>
{% capture ingredients %}
Serves 2-3

Yield: 1/2 cup curry paste


For the curry paste: 

1 large handful of cilantro (coriander) 
1 thumb of ginger - about an inch square 
1-2 green chillis (feel free to add more if you want a real kick)  
1 stalk lemongrass
1 handful basil leaves
1 tsp crushed black peppercorns
1 tsp toasted cumin seeds, ground
1 tsp coriander seeds, crushed
Juice and zest of 2 limes
2 tsp soy sauce
3 tbsp olive oil


For the curry:
2-3 cups assorted vegetables 
(I used: 10 baby new potatoes, 5 stalks asparagus, 1 carrot, 1/4 cauliflower in florets, 1/2 a Chinese eggplant, 1/2 a zucchini)
1 can coconut milk
2 tsp brown sugar sugar 
Salt to taste 
1/4 cup roasted cashews (optional)
{% endcapture %}
{% capture method %}
<ol>
<li>To prepare your curry paste, simply blitz all the ingredients in a food processor until it resembles a paste. This is enough paste for 8 people. You may freeze half of it or refrigerate for up to two weeks.</li>
<li>Remove half of the paste and store in an airtight jar or container. Leave the remaining paste in the food processor.</li>
<li>Cook the vegetables using your preferred method. (I steamed the cauliflower, potato and carrot until tender. While they cooked, I sautéed the remaining vegetables in a tablespoon of olive oil on a very hot griddle pan)</li>
<li>Add the can of coconut milk to the food processor and blitz until it has combined into a very pale green sauce. (If you want to add even more veg to your curry, you could throw a generous handful of spinach into the food processor.</li>
<li>Transfer the curry sauce to a sauce pan and bring it to a simmering heat. Add all the vegetables (and cashews if using) to the sauce and cook for a further 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Have a quick taste and add salt or sugar if necessary.</li>
<li>Serve with steamed rice.</li>
</ol>
