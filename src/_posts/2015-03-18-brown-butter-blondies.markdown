<p>These blondies are the most indulgent and heavenly thing I have baked in a long time. There’s absolutely nothing virtuous about this recipe but when you bite into one, you’ll lose your mind and won’t care.</p>
<p>Blondies are basically brownies made without the cocoa and require brown sugar rather than white so the sweetness is deeper, more treacly.</p>
<p>Please do use vanilla bean paste if you can, it seriously makes a huge difference in this recipe; there are so few ingredients so you can really taste it.</p>
<p>I used very dark chocolate – 85% cocoa solids – and it cuts through the sugar and butter perfectly. You could substitute milk or white if you dislike bittersweet chocolate.</p>
<p>You’d be very silly not to give these a go, I promise.</p>
<p>As with regular brownies, they are at their best and fudgiest on the day you bake them. However, they will keep for up to 3 days in an airtight container.</p>
{% capture ingredients %}
1 cup butter
1 1/4 cups light brown sugar
1 tsp salt
2 cups flour
2/3 cup soft-medium tofu
1 tsp vanilla bean paste
1 cup dark chocolate, cut into small chunks
{% endcapture %}
{% capture method %}
<ol>
<li>Cut your butter into cubes of approximately equal size - this will allow it all to melt at the same rate.</li>
<li>Melt the butter in a saucepan over a low to medium heat.</li>
<li>Swirl it around in the pan, and cook for 3-4 minutes until it starts to smell nutty.</li>
<li>Pour the butter into a medium sized mixing bowl and set aside.</li>
<li>Preheat your oven to 180C or 350F. Line a square 8 inch x 8 inch baking tin with parchment paper.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, mash your tofu down until it is totally broken down. Mix in the vanilla bean paste.</li>
<li>Add the brown sugar to the bowl of butter and mix for 30 seconds with a wooden spoon.</li>
<li>Add the tofu/vanilla mixture to the butter/sugar mixture and stir for 30 seconds.</li>
<li>Add the flour and salt to the butter/sugar/tofu mixture and combine slowly.</li>
<li>When there are still a few pockets of flour remaining, fold in the chocolate chunks.</li>
<li>As soon as it is all combined, pour the mix into your lined tin.</li>
<li>Using your wooden spoon, pat it down to ensure it is distributed evenly.</li>
<li>Bake for 25-27 minutes. You can't do a skewer test with this recipe but the blondies will be firm at the edges and ever so slightly browned.</li>
<li>Remove from oven and allow to cool for at least 15 minutes before attempting to cut - it won't cut cleanly if you do it too soon.</li>
<li>That said, these are DIVINE when still warm so don't wait too long!</li>
</ol>
