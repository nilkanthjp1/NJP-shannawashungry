<p>This recipe is a family favourite. Raspberries and almonds work really well together. The flavours are reminiscent of a Bakewell tart. Adding ground almonds to the sponge provides extra moisture <em>and</em> flavour to your bake. It also makes the sponge much lighter, which is sometimes difficult to achieve without egg.</p>
<p>Being a traybake, it’s great to make for a large group of people. You can easily double the recipe and bake it in a larger tray, such as a jelly roll pan (13″ x 18″). If not, a 9″x 9″ for a thicker sponge, or 9″ x 13″ work really well.</p>
{% capture ingredients %}
For the sponge: 

3/4 cup self raising flour
1/2 cup caster sugar or extra-fine granulated sugar
2 tbsp ground almonds
3/4 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda (bicarbonate of soda)
a pinch of salt
1 1/2 tbsp golden syrup
1/2 tbsp vinegar
1/3 cup warm milk
1/4 cup sunflower oil
1/4 tsp almond extract
3/4 - 1 cup raspberries, fresh or frozen - this is really up to you. As little or as much as you like!
Flaked almonds - as above

For the almond glaze:
1/2 cup icing/powdered sugar
3 drops almond extract
1 tbsp milk

<li>Line your baking tray with baking parchment.</li>
<li>In a mixing bowl, sift the dry ingredients <strong>in the following order</strong>: sugar, flour, ground almonds, salt, baking soda, baking powder.</li>
<li>Add the golden syrup but avoid placing it on the baking powder and baking soda.</li>
<li>Add the vinegar directly onto the baking powder and soda. The ingredients will react and you’ll see lots of bubbles. This is exactly what you’re looking for.</li>
<li>In quick succession, add the milk and oil.</li>
<li>Mix the ingredients together until smooth. Beat for a further two minutes.</li>
<li>Spoon the mixture into the baking tin. Spread until smooth.</li>
<li>Top with the raspberries, some whole some broken into pieces.</li>
<li>Cover the rest of the sponge with the flaked almonds.</li>
<li>Bake for 20 minutes, until golden and until the top of the cake bounces back when gently pressed.</li>
<li>Let the sponge cool completely before glazing.</li>
<li>Sift the icing sugar into a bowl. Add the remaining ingredients. If you prefer a looser consistency add a tsp more milk. Spoon drizzles of the glaze across the sponge.</li>
</ol>
