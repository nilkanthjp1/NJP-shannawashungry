<p>After 6 months in the States, I returned to London the other week. It was so good to be home! Unsurprisingly, within hours of arriving I couldn’t help but bake something in the kitchen I’d grown up in — using the oven that has seen many a triumph and MANY a failure over the years. I can confidently say that these cookies <em>were</em> a total triumph, mostly because they’re adapted from the infallible Izy Hossack of <a href="http://www.topwithcinnamon.com/">Top With Cinnamon</a>. I used tofu to replace the egg, which keeps the cookies moist and chewy.</p>
<p>I took these cookies to a dinner party and everyone loved them. A couple of points:</p>
<p>Yes, there really are potato chips/crisps in these cookies.<br/>
Yes, they taste amazing!</p>
<p>Dark chocolate and sea salt cookies are hugely popular at the moment; this is a quirky alternative. The potato chips/crisps permeate the whole cookie and offer a very subtle note of saltiness (sometimes a sprinkle on top of the cookie is a bit much for some people – not me!).</p>
<p>I know it sounds crazy, but this not-so-secret ingredient is a great addition to your cookie dough. I hope you’ll give it a try.</p>
{% capture ingredients %}
Yield: makes 15 small cookies

10 tbsp butter
1 3/4 cup plain / all purpose flour 
3/4 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup + 1 1/2 tbsp light brown sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1 1/2 tbsp soft-medium tofu
1/2 cup ready salted potato chips/crisps, crushed
90g dark chocolate, chopped into chunks

{% capture method %}
<ol>
<li class="instruction" id="zlrecipe-instruction-0">Melt the butter in a saucepan over a low-medium heat. It will melt, then bubble and foam. Once it darkens slightly and begins to smell nutty, remove from the heat and allow to cool for ten minutes.</li>
<li class="instruction">In a large bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer, measure out the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and sugars. If you aren't using a stand mixer, mix the ingredients in the bowl.</li>
<li class="instruction">Pour in the melted butter gradually.</li>
<li class="instruction">Break the tofu down until it is totally mushy and add it to the bowl.</li>
<li class="instruction">Stir the ingredients until it resembles a slightly crumbly, sandy dough.</li>
<li class="instruction">Fold in the chocolate and potato chips/crisps.</li>
<li class="instruction">Form your cookies, approximately 2 tbsp per cookie.</li>
<li class="instruction">Refrigerate the dough in an airtight container for at least 2 hours (but you can do so for up to 3 days - the longer the better).</li>
<li class="instruction">Once you're ready to bake them, preheat the oven to 180C or 350F.</li>
<li class="instruction">Line a baking tray with parchment and place the cookies on it, spacing them 2-3 inches apart.</li>
<li class="instruction">Bake for 13-15 minutes. They will have spread, puffed up slightly and should be ever so slightly golden.</li>
<li class="instruction">Let them cool on the baking tray for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.</li>
</ol>
