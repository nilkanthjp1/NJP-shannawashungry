<p>This mushroom tikka makes a great side dish or even a starter/appetizer. I made it to accompany tadka dal and paratha and it was pretty perfect.</p>
<p>I <em>very slightly</em> adapted it from <a href="http://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/">Veg Recipes of India</a>. This is so uncomplicated – just one mixing bowl and then throw it under the grill. Enjoy! If you recreate it let me know on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shannawashungry/">Instagram</a>!</p>

{% capture method %}
<ol>
<li>Slice off the top layer of each mushroom stalk and ensure all the mushrooms have been wiped well. (If you wash mushrooms they will become extremely soggy and release tons of moisture when cooked - bleurgh)</li>
<li>In a mixing bowl, and add all the ingredients <strong>except</strong> the flour and coriander leaves. Stir well to combine.</li>
<li>Cover the bowl and set aside to marinade for at least 30 minutes.</li>
<li>If you plan to skewer the mushrooms, soak your skewers in cold water (to prevent burning under the grill)</li>
<li>When you're ready to cook the mushrooms, preheat your grill/broiler.</li>
<li>Add the flour to the marinaded mushrooms and stir to coat each mushroom evenly in the batter.</li>
<li>Skewer the mushrooms if you wish. If not, simply lay some foil out on a baking tray and drizzle some oil onto it. Place the mushrooms on the sheet and drizzle lightly with oil.</li>
<li>Grill/broil the mushrooms for 12-15 minutes, flipping half way through. Keep an eye on them to prevent burning.</li>
<li>Once cooked, garnish with fresh coriander and serve hot with fresh lime or lemon wedges.</li>
</ol>
