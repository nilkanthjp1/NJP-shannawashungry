<p>This cheesecake is a little fussy. It’s not a 5 ingredient-one bowl-throw it all in a food processor recipe. But good things come to those who werrk/wait/make baked cheesecake. You have to plan ahead a little, as you’ll need to bake it the day before you want to eat it. <a href="http://www.shannawashungry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_6490.jpg"><br/>
</a></p>
<p>Another note: digestive biscuits are <em>essential </em>for cheesecake heaven. I’ve noticed that most (if not all) American recipes call for graham crackers. They’ll work but results with digestives are better. Digestive biscuits can be found quite easily in the States – large supermarkets have International sections and you’ll often find them there. If not, Indian grocery stores and Amazon also stock them.</p>
<p>Baked cheesecakes without eggs <em>are</em> difficult but this recipe does simplify things. EnerG egg replacer is an absolute godsend – it sets the mixture wonderfully every time.</p>
<p><strong>PS.</strong> You could make this as one large baked cheesecake (as pictured) in a 9″ springform tin:</p>
<p>1. Double the recipe.<br/>
2. Bake for 45-50 minutes.<br/>
3. Switch off oven, then keep it in there for a further 25 before removing.</p>
<p> </p>
{% capture ingredients %}
For the base:
1 1/2 cups digestive biscuit crumbs (approx. 10 biscuits) 
4 tbsp butter, melted

For the blueberry swirl
1 cup blueberries 
1 tsp corn starch
1 tbsp water
1 tbsp sugar
1 tbsp lemon juice

For the cheesecake:
1/2 cup caster sugar
1 cup + 2tbsp cream cheese, brought to room temperature
1/4 cup sour cream
1/2 tsp vanilla bean paste
1 tbsp lemon juice
2 tsp EnerG Egg replacer (corn starch will work if you don't have the egg replacer)
1/2 cup milk

You will need a loose bottomed individual cupcake pan OR a silicone cupcake pan for this recipe.

</a>Make the blueberry sauce:
<ol>
<li>In a small bowl, whisk together the corn starch, lemon juice and water, then set aside.</li>
<li>Over a medium heat, warm the blueberries and sugar in a non stick saucepan.</li>
<li>Stir continuously for 2-3 minutes until the blueberries begin to release their juice.</li>
<li>Add the corn starch mixture to the blueberries and continue to stir for 2 minutes.</li>
<li>The blueberries will have softened by now so smash most of them as you stir.</li>
<li>As the corn starch heats, the mixture will thicken.</li>
<li>Remove from heat and pour the mixture through a fine mesh strainer.</li>
<li>Retain the whole blueberries for later and set the thickened blueberry sauce to one side.</li>
</ol>
Make the base:
<ol>
<li>Break the digestives into halves and thirds. Transfer to a food processor and pulse until they have broken down totally.</li>
<li>Melt the butter and combine with the crumbs.</li>
<li>Press 2 tbsp of the crumb mixture into each cup of the tray. Pack the crumbs tightly.</li>
<li>Preheat your oven to 356F or 180C.</li>
</ol>
Make the cheesecake:
<ol>
<li>Combine all the cheesecake ingredients <strong>EXCEPT</strong> the lemon juice in a mixing bowl. If the cream cheese is still quite solid from the fridge, you may want to use a hand blender to quickly bring the mixture together.</li>
<li>Add the lemon juice and combine.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the cheesecake bases with the whole blueberries you saved from the sauce.</li>
<li>Pour 2 tbsp of the cream cheese mixture into each cup.</li>
<li>Dot each cheesecake with a teaspoon of the blueberry sauce.</li>
<li>Using a skewer, gently swirl the mixture to create a marble effect. Use as much as desired and set the remainder aside for serving with the cheesecake.</li>
<li>Bake the cheesecakes for 15 minutes. They should still have a slight wobble at the centre once baked - it will firm up as it cools.</li>
<li>Switch off the oven, open the door slightly and keep the cheesecake in the oven for a further 7 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove from oven and allow to cool completely at room temperature.</li>
<li>Refrigerate overnight before serving.</li>
</ol>
