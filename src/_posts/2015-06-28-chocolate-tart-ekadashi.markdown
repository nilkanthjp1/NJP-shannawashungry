<p>This recipe is adapted from the wonderful Sylvie of <a href="http://gourmandeinthekitchen.com/">Gourmande in the Kitchen</a>. It was pretty much flawless and one of the best vegan desserts I’ve had in a while.</p>
<p>The use of coconut milk instead of heavy cream for the ganache is genius. Both heavy cream and coconut milk are indulgent but in my opinion, the coconut adds more flavour without compromising on texture. The crust is so simple to throw together. Of course you can make this as a sweet treat on Ekadashi but honestly, it’s a welcome dessert on any day. Just be sure to serve it with berries – they offset the rich chocolate perfectly.</p>
<p>PS. The tart that’s pictured is a miniature version – I wanted to use my individual tart pan and quartered the recipe.</p>
{% capture ingredients %}
For the crust:

½ cup unsweetened shredded coconut or coconut flour
1 ½ cups almond flour/meal
2 Tablespoons coconut or olive oil
¼ tsp salt
2 Tablespoons/30 g maple syrup

For the ganache:
1 scant* cup full fat coconut milk
1 3/4 cup soy-free bittersweet chocolate chips 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

*Use just under a cup 

You will need a 9 inch loose bottomed tart pan for this recipe

<div class="instruction-label" id="zlrecipe-instruction-0">Make the tart shell:</div>
<ol class="instructions">
<ol class="instructions">
<li class="instruction" id="zlrecipe-instruction-1">Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a food processor, pulse together almond flour, salt and shredded coconut until finely ground. If using coconut oil, melt it and add to the food processor along with the maple syrup (if using olive oil, add directly). Pulse until coarse crumbs form - you'll know it's ready if you squeeze some in your hands it and it clumps together.</li>
<li class="instruction" id="zlrecipe-instruction-2">Transfer the mixture to the tart pan. Press the dough evenly into the bottom and sides of the pan. The flat bottom of a measuring cup is helpful to press the crust in.</li>
<li class="instruction" id="zlrecipe-instruction-3">Bake in the centre of your oven until golden and firm, about 15- 20 minutes.</li>
<li class="instruction">Once baked, transfer to a wire rack and allow crust to cool completely - one hour minimum</li>
