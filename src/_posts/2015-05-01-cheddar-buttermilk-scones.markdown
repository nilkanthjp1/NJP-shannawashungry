<p>These scones are really quick to put together – 30 mins start to finish. And the finish involves warm scones oozing with cheddar. It’s a good finish if you ask me. The jalapeño adds a good kick of spice but you can add or subtract the amount according to your spice preference.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy them!</p>

<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 390F or 200C.</li>
<li>Mix the flour and salt together.</li>
<li>Add the grated butter and rub it in until the mixture resembles fine crumbs.</li>
<li>Add half of the cheddar to the mixture along with the jalapeños.</li>
<li>Make a well in the centre of the mixture and pour in the buttermilk.</li>
<li>Swiftly stir the mixture until it comes together to form a soft dough.</li>
<li>Knead the dough for a couple of minutes on a lightly floured surface.</li>
<li>Roll the dough out to a 1 inch thick square.</li>
<li>Quarter the dough into 4 squares, then cut each square diagonally. This will give you 8 triangles of dough.</li>
<li>Measure out a tablespoon of buttermilk on a small plate and brush the scones with it.</li>
<li>Sprinkle more cheddar atop the scones if desired, then bake for 12-14 minutes until they have puffed up and are golden brown.</li>
</ol>
