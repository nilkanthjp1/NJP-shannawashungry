<p>This is a great way to incorporate extra vegetables into a traditional meal of spaghetti with marinara! The wheatballs add extra flavour, texture and novelty and are very easy to put together.</p>
{% capture ingredients %}
Serves 2
Yield: 10 wheatballs 

For the wheatballs:
1 cup sliced mushrooms
1/2 cup cauliflower florets
3/4 cup vegan bread crumbs
1/4 cup walnut halves
1 tsp oregano or Italian seasoning
1 tbsp fresh rosemary, chopped
1/2 tsp salt
Cracked black pepper

2 cups vegan homemade sauce

I used: 
1 can of peeled plum tomatoes
1 large red bell pepper, broiled, blackened, skin peeled and then blended with the plum tomatoes
Salt and cracked black pepper
Dried oregano
A drizzle of extra virgin olive oil 

&amp; 2oz dried spaghetti per person
