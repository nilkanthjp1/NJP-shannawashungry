<p>Using cauliflower and cashews, this recipe produces a very convincing vegan ricotta. Paired with spinach and marinara, you really can’t go wrong.</p>
<p>This dish can be made in advance and baked just before serving. Enjoy!</p>
{% capture ingredients %}
Serves 2

12 jumbo pasta shells

For the marinara:
1 red pepper
1 can crushed tomatoes
1 handful fresh rosemary leaves
salt and pepper to taste

For the vegan ricotta:
½ cup cashews, soaked for 3 hours
1 cup cauliflower 'rice' (approx 5-6 florets,  pulsed in a food processor)
1/2 tsp nutritional yeast
1 tsp salt
juice of half a lemon 
1/2 cup wilted spinach
{% endcapture %}
{% capture method %}
<ol>
<li>Preheat your broiler/grill.</li>
<li>Wash, halve and deseed the red pepper.</li>
<li>Place the halves on a foil-lined baking tray and grill under broiler/grill until the skin is blackened on 50% of it.</li>
<li>Remove the tray from the broiler/grill and seal up the foil around the peppers. Leave for 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Open the foil parcel and peel off the red pepper skins.</li>
<li>Blend the roasted pepper with the can of crushed tomatoes. Season with salt, pepper and chilli flakes to taste. Add the rosemary and simmer on a low heat for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Cook the jumbo shells in boiling water for 8-9 minutes.</li>
<li>While the marinara simmers, you can begin making the ricotta. Pulse the soaked cashews in a food processor until they resemble ricotta.</li>
<li>Transfer the cashews to a bowl and add the cauliflower rice, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, salt and spinach.</li>
<li>Preheat your oven to 350F or 180 degrees Celsius.</li>
<li>Slather some marinara at the bottom of the baking dish you're using.</li>
<li>Once your pasta shells have drained and cooled, stuff each shell with the 'ricotta' and place in the baking dish.</li>
<li>Drizzle more marinara atop the shells.</li>
<li>Bake in the oven for 25 minutes.</li>
</ol>
