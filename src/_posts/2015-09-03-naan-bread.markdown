<p>Homemade naan really is so much tastier than store-bought. Conventional ‘coriander naan’ recipes will use the herb as a garnish. I use it in the dough itself. It adds great depth of flavour and is more practical – garnishes fall off. This recipe is really simple – you just need to allow yourself enough time for the dough to rise. It’s worth the wait though – the naan will be super soft and fluffy, slightly crisp at the edges and the perfect way to mop up a good curry!</p>

{% capture ingredients %}
1 ½  tsp active dry yeast
2 tbsp warm water
1 tsp sugar

½ cup warm water
1tsp salt
1 ½ cups all purpose flour
5 tbsp yogurt
2 tbsp melted ghee or butter
3-4 tbsp freshly chopped coriander (cilantro)
2 tsp nigella/black cumin seeds
{% endcapture %}
{% capture method %}
<ol>
<li>In a bowl, stir the yeast, sugar and 2 tbsp of warm water. Ensure the yeast is stirred well into the water. Leave it to one side for 10 minutes, until it is frothy.</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.</li>
<li>Add the yogurt to the frothy mixture.</li>
<li>Create a well in the flour, then pour in the yogurt/yeast mixture, followed by the ghee, coriander and seeds.</li>
<li>Use your finger tips to bring the dough ingredients together.</li>
<li>Little by little, add the water until you have a soft sticky dough.</li>
<li>Transfer the mixture to a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 minutes. The dough should be smooth and really soft. If you feel it's too sticky, you can add a spoon of flour.</li>
<li>Lightly grease a large mixing bowl that will accommodate double the size of the dough.</li>
<li>Roll the dough around in the ball until it's lightly coated in the oil.</li>
<li>Cover the bowl with a damp cloth or cling film, then place it in an unlit oven or another draught-free place for 1.5 hours until the dough has doubled in size.</li>
<li>Return the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead gently to remove the air pockets. Divide the dough (I use a pizza cutter) into 8 balls.</li>
<li>Heat a non-stick frying pan over a high heat.</li>
<li>Roll out the balls into 5 inch discs. Then using your hands, stretch the first disc out to a tear drop shape, before placing onto the hot pan. When bubbles form, flip it over. Cook until the underside has brown patches. Flip and cook for a further 30 seconds. Remove from the pan and brush with butter. Repeat for remaining dough balls.</li>
<li>Serve warm.</li>
</ol>
