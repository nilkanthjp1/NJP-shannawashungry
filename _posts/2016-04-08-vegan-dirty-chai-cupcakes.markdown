<p>I discovered the magic of ‘dirty chai’ in San Francisco recently – I had a ‘dirty horchata’ bubble tea and it was pretty much life-changing: spiced chai <em>and</em> a shot of espresso. Why choose between chai and coffee when you can have the best of both?</p>
{% capture ingredients %}
12 cupcakes 

For the chai cupcakes:
1½ cups self-raising flour
½ cup vegan caster sugar or extra-fine granulated sugar
1½ tsp baking powder
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
¼ tsp salt
½ tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp ground ginger
½ tsp ground nutmeg
2 tbsp maple syrup
2 tbsp Earth Balance cinnamon spread, melted (optional)
1 tbsp vinegar
½ cup oil (canola or sunflower work best)
¾ cup almond milk

For the espresso frosting:
1/2 cup vegan butter (I used one stick of Earth Balance vegan buttery sticks)
2 ½ - 3 cups powdered sugar 
3-4 tbsp espresso

<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 180C or 350F.</li>
<li>Remove the vegan butter from the refrigerator to allow it to soften.</li>
<li>Line a cupcake pan with paper cases.</li>
<li>In a mixing bowl, sift the dry ingredients <b>(including the spices)</b></li>
<li>Melt the cinnamon spread if using it.</li>
<li>Add the maple syrup and cinnamon spread to the dry ingredients.</li>
<li>Add the vinegar directly onto the baking powder and soda. The ingredients will react and you’ll see lots of bubbles. This is exactly what you’re looking for.</li>
<li>In quick succession, add the almond milk and oil.</li>
<li>Mix the ingredients together until smooth. Beat for a further two minutes.</li>
<li>Spoon the mixture into the cases, distributing it evenly.</li>
<li>Bake the cupcakes for approximately 16 minutes. When the top of a cupcake is pressed gently, it should bounce back up. If it doesn’t, bake for a further 2 minutes, until it does bounce back.</li>
<li>Let the cupcakes cool in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.</li>
<li>Make an espresso (or strong coffee) and set aside to cool.</li>
<li>While the cupcakes and coffee cools, prepare the frosting.</li>
<li>To a mixing bowl, add the softened vegan butter and beat until smooth.</li>
<li>Gradually add the powdered sugar and espresso - ½ cup of sugar and 1 tbsp of espresso at a time, until you have a smooth buttercream texture</li>
<li>Frost your cupcakes.</li>
<li>Top with more cinnamon powder and/or espresso powder.</li>
<li>Devour!</li>
</ol>
