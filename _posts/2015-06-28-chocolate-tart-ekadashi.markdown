method: >
  <div id="zlrecipe-instruction-0" class="instruction-label">Make the tart shell:</div>
  <ol class="instructions">
  <ol class="instructions">
  <li id="zlrecipe-instruction-1" class="instruction">Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a food processor, pulse together almond flour, salt and shredded coconut until finely ground. If using coconut oil, melt it and add to the food processor along with the maple syrup (if using olive oil, add directly). Pulse until coarse crumbs form - you'll know it's ready if you squeeze some in your hands it and it clumps together.</li>
  <li id="zlrecipe-instruction-2" class="instruction">Transfer the mixture to the tart pan. Press the dough evenly into the bottom and sides of the pan. The flat bottom of a measuring cup is helpful to press the crust in.</li>
  <li id="zlrecipe-instruction-3" class="instruction">Bake in the centre of your oven until golden and firm, about 15- 20 minutes.</li>
  <li class="instruction">Once baked, transfer to a wire rack and allow crust to cool completely - one hour minimum</li>
  </ol>
  </ol>
  <div id="zlrecipe-instruction-4" class="instruction-label">Make the ganache:</div>
  <ol class="instructions">
  <ol class="instructions">
  <li id="zlrecipe-instruction-7" class="instruction">Place chocolate in a large mixing bowl.</li>
  <li class="instruction">In a small saucepan, bring the coconut milk to a boil. Pour the hot coconut milk over the chocolate and let it stand for 1 minute, then stir the mixture until smooth and creamy. Mix in the vanilla extract.</li>
  </ol>
  </ol>
  <div id="zlrecipe-instruction-8" class="instruction-label">Assemble your tart:</div>
  <ol id="zlrecipe-instructions-list" class="instructions">

<p>This recipe is adapted from the wonderful Sylvie of <a href="http://gourmandeinthekitchen.com/">Gourmande in the Kitchen</a>. It was pretty much flawless and one of the best vegan desserts I’ve had in a while.</p>
<p>The use of coconut milk instead of heavy cream for the ganache is genius. Both heavy cream and coconut milk are indulgent but in my opinion, the coconut adds more flavour without compromising on texture. The crust is so simple to throw together. Of course you can make this as a sweet treat on Ekadashi but honestly, it’s a welcome dessert on any day. Just be sure to serve it with berries – they offset the rich chocolate perfectly.</p>
<p>PS. The tart that’s pictured is a miniature version – I wanted to use my individual tart pan and quartered the recipe.</p>
