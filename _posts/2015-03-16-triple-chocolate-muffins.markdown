ingredients: >
  Yield: 6 large muffins
  
  3/4 cup self raising flour
  2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa 
  1/4 cup caster sugar/ extra-fine granulated sugar
  1/4 tsp baking soda (bicarbonate of soda)
  3/4 tsp baking powder 
  a pinch of salt
  1 1/2 tbsp golden syrup (if you don't have golden syrup, you could substitute honey)
  6 tbsp warm milk
  1/4 cup sunflower oil or other neutral oil
  1/2 tbsp vinegar 
  White and dark chocolate, 25g of each
  
method: >
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat your oven to 180C or 350F.</li>
  <li>Line a 6 cup muffin tray with paper cases.</li>
  <li>Chop your white and dark chocolate into chunks.</li>
  <li>In a mixing bowl, sift the dry ingredients <strong>in the following order</strong>: cocoa, sugar, flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder.</li>
  <li>Add the golden syrup but avoid placing it on the baking powder and baking soda.</li>
  <li>Add the vinegar directly onto the baking powder and soda. The ingredients will react and you’ll see lots of bubbles. This is exactly what you’re looking for.</li>
  <li>In quick succession, add the milk and oil.</li>
  <li>Mix the ingredients together until smooth. Beat for a further two minutes.</li>
  <li>Spoon the muffin mixture into the cases, distributing it evenly between the 6 - about 2 generous tablespoons per muffin.</li>
  <li>Top each muffin with the white and dark chocolate chunks.</li>
  <li>Bake the muffins for 16 minutes. When the top of the muffin is pressed gently, it should bounce back up. If it doesn't cook for a further 2 minutes, until it does bounce back.</li>
  </ol>
