method: >
  <h3>Make your pie crust dough:</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>Measure out flour, salt and sugar into a bowl and combine. You may want to use the bowl of your stand mixer if you don't want to knead your pastry dough by hand.</li>
  <li>Add the grated butter and use your fingers to incorporate the butter into the flour. Keep going until the mixture resembles sand, with very few lumps.</li>
  <li>At this point, make a well in the mixture and add the buttermilk. Either with a fork or with your stand mixer, bring the dough together and knead for 3-4 minutes or until you have a smooth ball of dough. I did use a stand mixer to bring the ingredients together but I would still recommend you knead by hand on a floured surface for a couple of minutes.</li>
  <li>Flatten your dough into a thick disc, wrap in cling film and refrigerate for an hour.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Make your filling:</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and mix well.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Make your pies:</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat your oven to 400F and remove dough from the fridge.</li>
  <li>Line a baking tray with parchment paper.</li>
  <li>On a well-floured surface, roll out your dough to a 1/8in thickness.</li>
  <li>Using a 2.5in round cookie cutter, cut out 18 discs. Cut out as many as you can before re-rolling the cut offs.</li>
  <li>Lay out 9 discs on the baking tray.</li>
  <li>Place a tablespoon of your apple mixture in the middle of each disc.</li>
  <li>If using, sprinkle a few flakes of fleur de sel atop the pie filling.</li>
  <li>Cover the apple mixture with another disc.</li>
  <li>Pinch the pies closed with your fingertips and then seal with the tines of a fork. Be sure to seal them well!</li>
  <li>Using a sharp knife point or a skewer, poke 3-4 vent holes into the lid of each pie. This will ensure they don't burst while baking.</li>
  <li>Using a pastry brush, brush your pies with the milk. This will give them a lovely golden colour as they bake.</li>
  <li>If using, sprinkle the pies with the demerera sugar.</li>
  <li>Bake for 17 minutes or until golden brown and bubbling.</li>
  <li>Allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
  </ol>

<p>I’ve been wanting to make miniature hand pies for a while, for two reasons:</p>
<p>A) They are unashamedly adorable and inviting.</p>
<p>B) It’s just more practical to be able to make a few tiny pies rather than one big one that might not get finished. This way, you can make a few and bake them all if you like, or freeze a few raw ones for a future pie craving (is it just me who gets those?).</p>
<p>I went with a classic apple-cinnamon filling because it’s a real crowd pleaser. I would absolutely insist on using Granny Smith apples. The tartness that they contribute to the flavour profile is essential. The recipe for the pie crust dough is from the wonderful <a href="http://joythebaker.com/2014/11/five-tips-best-butter-pie-crust-scratch/">Joy the Baker</a>.</p>
<p>*I didn’t have buttermilk so I improvised: 1/4 tbsp of lemon juice in 1/4 cup of milk. Leave for 10 mins before using.</p>
