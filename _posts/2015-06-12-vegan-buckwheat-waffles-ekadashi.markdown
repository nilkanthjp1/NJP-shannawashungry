<p>I just bought my first waffle iron (celebratory dance) and couldn’t <em>wait</em> to use it. So what if it’s ekadashi? I’ll just make some grain-free ones!</p>
<p>This recipe is so wholesome and you can’t tell that they’re wheat-free.</p>
<p>And if you don’t have a waffle iron, you can use this recipe to make buckwheat pancakes.</p>
<p>xo</p>
