<p>I’m an unapologetic grazer. Waiting 5 hours between meals ain’t for me. As a result, I try to make sure that what I’m snacking on is wholesome, unprocessed and ideally homemade. In all honesty, once I tried baking my own vegetable crisps/chips, store bought versions paled in comparison. These crisps/chips are super easy to make. Keeping it simple with just a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper means you can really taste the vegetables.</p>
<p>You will need a mandolin for this recipe.</p>
{% capture ingredients %}
2 potatoes 
2 beetroots 
Olive Oil
Sea Salt
{% endcapture %}
{% capture method %}
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 400F</li>
<li>Wash and peel your vegetables</li>
<li>Using the thin slicing setting on your mandolin, slice your vegetables into discs.</li>
<li>Place the slices in a bowl and dress the vegetables with a glug of olive oil until they are very lightly coated.</li>
<li>Evenly season the vegetables with the salt and black pepper.</li>
<li>Place the vegetables on a non stick baking tray or a tray lined with baking parchment and lay them all out. They can be close to one another.</li>
<li>Depending on their size they'll cook within 20-30 minutes. Keep an eye on them. Beets take longer than potatoes so after 20 minutes, rotate the tray and let them bake for 10-15 mins more.</li>
<li>Once out of the oven, leave them on the tray to cool and crisp up.</li>
</ol>
