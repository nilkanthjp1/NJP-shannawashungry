<p>This recipe uses cannellini beans instead of nuts and cheese, which means it can feautre in many healthy meals.The cannellini beans give texture, creaminess and are a good source of protein.</p>
<p>I have omitted Italian hard cheeses like Parmesan and Pecorino because they contain animal rennet.</p>
