ingredients: >
  1½ cups self-raising flour
  ½ cup caster sugar or extra-fine granulated sugar
  1½ tsp baking powder
  ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
  ¼ tsp salt
  1 tsp ground ginger
  1 tbsp vinegar
  ½ cup oil (canola or sunflower work best)
  ¾ cup almond milk (dairy is fine if you're not vegan)
  3 tbsp maple syrup
  1 cup diced rhubarb + 1 stalk sliced lengthways 
  2 tbsp stem ginger syrup/ginger jam/strawberry jam
method: >
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat your oven to 350F or 180 Celsius.</li>
  <li>Line a loaf tin with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
  <li>In a large mixing bowl, measure out the dry ingredients and whisk to combine.</li>
  <li>To the mixing bowl, add the vinegar, oil, almond milk and maple syrup. Stir until you have a smooth cake batter. If the batter is too loose, add more almond milk 1 tbsp at a time.</li>
  <li>Fold in the sliced rhubarb.</li>
  <li>Transfer the mixture to the loaf tin.</li>
  <li>Top the mixture with the long slices of rhubarb.</li>
  <li>Brush them with the syrup or jam.</li>
  <li>Bake for 35 minutes, or until the top of the cake bounces back when gently pressed. You can also insert a skewer into the cake - if it comes out clean, it's cooked.</li>
  <li>Allow the cake to cool for 10 minutes before attempting to remove from the tin.</li>
  <li>Serve warm with custard.</li>
  </ol>

<p>There’s such a small window in the year when we can enjoy rhubarb. When it appears, make the most of it! This rhubarb ginger loaf cake is the perfect place to start – the flavours go so well together, it’s a simple recipe and one you’ll go back to again and again. And as with most things rhubarb, serve with custard!</p>
