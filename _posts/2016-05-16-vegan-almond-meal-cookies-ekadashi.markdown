ingredients: >
  1¼ cup almond meal
  ¼ cup bittersweet chocolate, chopped
  ½ cup shredded unsweetened coconut 
  ¼ tsp salt
  ½ tsp baking powder
  ¼ cup soft brown sugar (I used coconut sugar)
  3 tbsp liquid coconut oil 
  ¼ tsp vanilla bean paste
  ¼ cup thoroughly mashed ripe banana
  
method: >
  <ol>
  <li>In a mixing bowl, measure out all the dry ingredients and stir through.</li>
  <li>Whisk together the coconut oil, vanilla and mashed banana and add to the mixing bowl.</li>
  <li>Fold the ingredients until combined.</li>
  <li>Chill the dough in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>When you're ready to bake, preheat your oven to 375F or 190C.</li>
  <li>Using a cookie scoop (or tablespoon if you don't have one), shape your cookie dough into 1 inch balls.</li>
  <li>Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spacing 2 inches apart. Press them down slightly into rounds.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle with sea salt or pink Himalayan salt.</li>
  <li>Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes until golden brown at the edges.</li>
  <li>Let them cool on the baking sheet before moving them - they will be quite delicate.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Sometimes you need a chocolate chip cookie and you need it to not fill you with immediate regret. If you can relate, you came to the right place. These cookies are soft and chewy and studded with bittersweet chocolate. The coconut sings through from the coconut oil, sugar <em>and</em> shredded coconut so ‘you’re welcome’ coconut fans.</p>
<p>These aren’t exactly low in fat but they’re free of refined sugar if you use coconut sugar like I did, and they’re gluten-free and ekadashi-friendly (do I need to provide any more reasons to bake these? Didn’t think so.</p>
