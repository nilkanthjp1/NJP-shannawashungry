ingredients: >
  2 tbsp Earth Balance or other plant-based butter
  2 cups vegan marshmallows (I highly recommend Dandies)
  4 cups vegan rice krispie cereal 
  
  sea salt (optional)
  50g melted dark chocolate (optional)
method: >
  <ol>
  <li>In small non-stick saucepan, melt the vegan butter over a low heat. Add the marshmallows and stir until completely melted. Remove from heat.</li>
  <li>In a large mixing bowl, measure out the rice krispies.</li>
  <li>Using a spatula to scrape out as much as possible, pour the melted mixture into the mixing bowl. If you are using sea salt, you can a pinch now. Stir until all the cereal is well coated.</li>
  <li>Transfer the mixture into a 9x9inch pan. Press the mixture down and ensure it is evenly distributed.</li>
  <li>If using, melt the dark chocolate in a small bowl in 30 second increments in the microwave.</li>
  <li>Drizzle the melted chocolate over the rice krispies.</li>
  <li>Once the mixture has cooled, cut the treats into 2in squares.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Rice Krispie treats were a favourite of mine as a child. Vegan marshmallows were elusive for so long (or perhaps I didn’t search hard enough) – either way, as soon as I found them, these were first on the list. They’re are fun, easy to make and super quick to put together.</p>
<p>I also add sea salt and very bitter dark chocolate to contrast the sweetness. Totally optional, but highly recommended!</p>
