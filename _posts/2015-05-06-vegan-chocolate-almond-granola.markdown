<p>After moving to the States, I picked up a late-night cereal habit (peer pressure). I accept that there are worse vices but I realised I was consuming so much sugar and wheat. This recipe is the result of trying to counter a Chocolate Toast Crunch addiction. And no offence to those guys over at General Mills, but this stuff is SO much better. It has all the flavour of a chocolatey cereal, but no refined sugar whatsoever. I plan to sprinkle it over warm oatmeal or greek yogurt and berries. This is a very simple, one-bowl recipe. I hope you give it a go!</p>
