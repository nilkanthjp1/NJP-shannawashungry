ingredients: >
  2 large apples (Bramley and Granny Smith are great for crumbles), peeled, cored and cubed
  1 cup blackberries 
  1 tbsp lemon juice
  3 tbsp sugar 
  1 tsp cinnamon
  
  
  For the crumble topping: 
  1 cup all purpose flour (125g)
  2 tbsp soft brown sugar (I used coconut sugar) 
  5 tbsp oats (50g)
  Pinch of salt
  ½ cup (100g) cold butter, cubed 
  ¼ (50g) cup mixed chopped nuts 
  
  
method: >
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 200˚C or 400F.</li>
  <li>Toss the cubed apple with the sugar, lemon juice and cinnamon. Stir through the blackberries, then scatter in an ovenproof dish.</li>
  <li>For the crumble topping, mix the flour, oats, sugar and a pinch of salt in a separate bowl.</li>
  <li>Using your fingers, rub in the cubed butter until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. If there are some bigger chunks, that's fine. Stir through the chopped nuts.</li>
  <li>Ensure the fruit in the ovenproof dish is distributed evenly so that the crumble topping follows suit. Scatter the crumble on top of the fruit. Don't press it down.</li>
  <li>Bake the crumble until golden and bubbling - approximately 35-40 minutes.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Crumbles are easily one of the easiest desserts you can make. Flour, butter, sugar, fruit. Purists would argue that’s all you need; I prefer to add oats and nuts to crumbles for more texture.</p>
<p>Most fruits work well in a crumble – pears, plums, peaches, rhubarb, blueberries etc. So if you don’t fancy apple and blackberry (don’t knock it ’til you’ve tried it), feel free to mix it up.</p>
<p>Apples and blackberries are somewhat autumnal but the minute I saw them at the farmer’s market this week, I knew I was going to be making this dish. I suggest you do the same.</p>
