ingredients: >
  1 3/4 cups self-raising flour (you can use whole wheat but expect a denser texture) 
  1/2 cup caster sugar/extra fine granulated sugar 
  1 1/2 tsp baking powder
  1/2 tsp baking soda 
  1/4 tsp salt
  1 cup buttermilk
  1/2 cup sunflower oil (or another neutral oil)
  1/2 tsp ground cinnamon 
  1/2 banana, mashed
  1/2 banana sliced lengthways (for the top of the bread)
  1/2 cup blueberries
  
method: >
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat your oven to 350F or 180C.</li>
  <li>Line a loaf tin with baking parchment.</li>
  <li>In a medium sized bowl mash the banana and leave to one side.</li>
  <li>In a second bowl (or the bowl of your stand mixer) sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer.</li>
  <li>Add in the oil, buttermilk and cinnamon. Mix until smooth.</li>
  <li>Pour half of the mix into the bowl wish the mashed banana and combine.</li>
  <li>Fold in the blueberries - leaving a few aside - to the plain mix.</li>
  <li>Carefully pour the banana mix to one side of the loaf tin.</li>
  <li>Transfer the blueberry mix to the other side of the loaf tin.</li>
  <li>Arrange the sliced banana atop the banana side and stud the other half with remaining blueberries.</li>
  <li>Bake for 50-55 minutes. Use a skewer or sharp knife and pierce the cake to the bottom of the tin. If it comes out clean, it's cooked all the way through. If it's nearly there, switch off the oven and leave it in there for 5 minutes before removing.</li>
  <li>Allow the loaf to cool for at least 15 minutes before gobbling.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Banana bread. Super quick to put together, it wafts insanely good bake-y smells all around the house. But what if one of you prefers blueberry bread? YOU MAKE THEM BOTH IN ONE TIN, THAT’S WHAT.</p>
<p>Introducing the Best of Both Banana Blueberry Buttermilk Breakfast-Friendly Bread.</p>
<p>There’s mashed banana running  through one side and for banana fiends, a thinly sliced banana baked into the top of it (which makes all the difference). And for those partial to tart blueberries, slice into the other side.</p>
<p>The fruit in this recipe does have a lot of sugar in it so there’s only 1/2 cup sugar. If you prefer your bakes on the sweeter side, add a couple of tablespoons of golden/maple syrup.</p>
<p>I’ve only recently begun baking with buttermilk and I’m totally converted (buttermilk pancake recipe coming soon – buttermilk in everything, always). It is slightly acidic and therefore reacts with the baking soda in the oven and creates a super moist and fluffy loaf. If you don’t have buttermilk, substitute regular milk with a tbsp of vinegar. Mix and leave for 10 minutes before using. That said, if you <em>can</em> find buttermilk, it’s so worth it.</p>
