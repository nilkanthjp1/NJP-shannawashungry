ingredients: >
  Yield: makes 8 macaroons
  
  1/2 cup + 1tbp unsweetened desiccated coconut
  1/2 cup reduced fat coconut milk
  1 tablespoon almond meal
  2 tbsp maple syrup
  Pinch of salt
  1 tsp potato/tapioca starch
  25g dark chocolate - minimum 70% cocoa solids - for drizzling (optional)
method: >
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat your oven to 350F/180C.</li>
  <li>Line a baking tray with parchment.</li>
  <li>Add the coconut milk and maple syrup to a saucepan on a medium heat and stir.</li>
  <li>Add the coconut, salt, almond meal and salt.</li>
  <li>Add the starch and combine.</li>
  <li>Once it has come together, cook for 1 minute, then remove from heat.</li>
  <li>Spoon tablespoonfuls of mixture into mounds onto the parchment. Use 2 tablespoons per mound. They will spread as they cook so keep them round and compact. Also be sure to space the macaroons 3 inches apart.</li>
  <li>Bake for 12-14 minutes until the macaroons are golden at the edges.</li>
  <li>Let the cookies cool on the tray for approximately 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Prepare your chocolate drizzle if using and in the mean time, refrigerate the macaroons.</li>
  <li>Break the chocolate into pieces and place in a microwaveable bowl. Microwave in 30 second increments, stirring each time until your chocolate is melted.</li>
  <li>Remove the macaroons from the refrigerator. Dip a spoon into the melted chocolate and drizzle over the macaroons.</li>
  <li>Gently lift them from the parchment once the chocolate has fully dried.<a href="http://shannawashungry.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1157.jpg">

<p>This recipe produces coconut macaroons that are:<br/>
a) vegan<br/>
b) grain-free<br/>
c) refined sugar-free</p>
<p>The macaroons are soft and chewy and the process is really simple. You’ll be done in 30 mins, start to finish!</p>
<p>I chose to make tiny macaroons (just one tbsp per cookie) but if you divide this recipe into 8 you’ll get much chunkier cookies than those pictured.</p>
