ingredients: >
  Yield: makes 12 bite-size cheesecakes
  
  For the base: 
  
  1 tbsp and 1 tsp coconut oil, melted
  1/4 cup maple syrup 
  1 tsp baking powder
  1/2 tsp of salt
  1/4 cup ground almonds
  4 tsp buckwheat flour 
  1/4 cup cocoa powder
  1 tbsp and 1 tsp almond milk 
  
  For the cheesecake:
  
  100g cream cheese
  28ml sour cream 
  1 tbsp sugar
  1 tbsp + 1 tsp  Ener-G egg replacer (a combination of potato and tapioca starch)
  2 tbsp almond milk 
  
   
  
method: >
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 350F.</li>
  <li>Prepare your brownie moulds - silicone baking moulds are ideal because the brownies can be removed more easily. If you don't have them, you could use cupcake cases in a cupcake tray.</li>
  <li>In a bowl combine the melted coconut oil and maple syrup.</li>
  <li>In succession, add the salt, baking powder, flour and cocoa.</li>
  <li>Fold in the ground almonds.</li>
  <li>Add in the almond milk and mix until you have a smooth brownie mix.</li>
  <li>Divide the brownie mixture between 12 cases or moulds.</li>
  <li>Bake for 6 minutes.</li>
  <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool.</li>
  <li>Combine all the cheesecake ingredients together.</li>
  <li>Top the brownies with the cheesecake mixture - between 1 1/2 and 2 tsp per brownie - and spread smoothly and as flat as possible.</li>
  <li>Return your moulds to the oven for 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Switch off your oven BUT leave the cheesecakes in there for a further 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool to room temperature.</li>
  <li>Refrigerate the cheesecakes for at least 2 hours. (If using silicone moulds, use the freezer for 45 minutes. They'll pop out of the moulds easily)</li>
  <li>Remove the cheesecake from the moulds and serve.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Guys! I’ve never been good at maths but the following formula is 100% correct:<br/>
Grain-free brownies + egg-free brownies – refined sugar = PERFECT GUILT FREE BROWNIES (that can also be made for Ekadashi).</p>
<p>Yup, that’s right. Honestly they’re super scrummy without the cheesecake topping. But I’m not gonna be that girl who said cheesecake is unnecessary. So make them with the cheesecake topping, ok?</p>
<p>A few things to mention:</p>
<ul>
<li>I used silicone moulds like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Freshware-CB-306SC-12-Pack-Silicone-Reusable/dp/B00GASLY56/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424745482&amp;sr=8-13&amp;keywords=silicone+mold+square">these</a> for this recipe and would recommend you do the same. If you don’t have silicone moulds, a mini muffin tray lined with muffin cases would work just as well.</li>
<li>When I say individual, I really do mean tiny – maybe 1 square inch. If you want bigger morsels, simply double/treble the recipe and use a cupcake tray.</li>
<li>Buckwheat is absolutely not a grain, and can be consumed on Ekadashi.</li>
<li>There are only two brownies in the photos because the others were gobbled quite early on. No regrets and no apologies.</li>
</ul>
