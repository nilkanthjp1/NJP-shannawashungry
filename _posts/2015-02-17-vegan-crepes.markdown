With a basic sweet crêpe recipe, you can be as imaginative and adventurous as you like with toppings and fillings. Some ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nutella</li>
<li>Roasted banana and Nutella</li>
<li>Warm fruit compote</li>
<li>Just a little lemon juice and powdered sugar.</li>
<li>Fresh strawberries and flaked almonds</li>
<li>Stewed apple with cinnamon</li>
</ol>
<p>I didn’t think crêpes would be easy to replicate without egg, but these ticked all the boxes. They’re delicately thin and therefore lighter than having a stack of pancakes. They’re slightly sweet, soft in the middle and crisper at the edges. Give them a go!</p>
