<p>Ok, so it doesn’t contain butter <em>or</em> chicken, but there’s no other name for it (is there?) I actually used a combination of tofu and vegan chicken strips from <a href="http://beyondmeat.com/">Beyond Meat</a>. I highly recommend both options – it really depends on what you might prefer/what you can get a hold of.</p>
<p>There are a few steps involved with this recipe but it comes together pretty quickly. As long as you get your tofu draining and your cashews soaking in good time, it won’t take long at all.</p>
<p>Feel free to adjust the spicing according to your personal taste – more green chilli, less cardamom etc. I didn’t actually use garam masala because it doesn’t agree with me but I feel like it would be rude not to include it, so there it is. I had some very (beginning-to-wrinkle) ripe grape tomatoes in the fridge and used those instead of crushed tomatoes. Basically, do what you want – fresh, canned, it’s all good and the results are all yum.</p>
<p>The curry is very flavourful and creamy without using cream or coconut milk (both lovely, but high in saturated fats). In order to keep this dish lean and high in just protein, I decided to use cashews for creaminess and they’re very effective. If you’d rather use cream or coconut milk, I’m sure it’ll be just as delicious!</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy this dish as much as we did – please do share your recreations with me!

{% capture ingredients %}
Serves 4:

2 12oz blocks extra-firm tofu 
1 red bell pepper

2-3 tbsp oil 
1 tsp cumin seeds 
3 cardamom pods
5-6 peppercorns

1 tbsp fresh minced green chilli
1 tsp garam masala (optional)
1 cup crushed tomatoes
salt, to taste
fresh coriander/cilantro to garnish

<ol>
<li>Drain your tofu. You could cut it into blocks but i broke it up with my hands to create chunks. Let the chunks drain for at least 30 minutes in a sieve to get rid of as much moisture as possible.</li>
<li>Remove the stalk of the bell pepper and slice in half. Lay the two halves (skin side up on a baking tray lined with foil. Broil/grill the pepper until the skin has blackened.</li>
<li>Once blackened, remove from the broiler/grill and fold the foil around the bell pepper to seal it and set aside for 2 minutes. Discard the skins from the bell pepper and set the pepper to one side.</li>
<li>Line the baking tray with baking parchment.</li>
<li>Gently press the chunks to remove any excess moisture. Place the tofu chunks on the tray in one layer, season with salt, and place under the broiler for 5-10 minutes until lightly browned. Flip the chunks over and broil again until the other side is lightly browned. Remove from the broiler/grill and set the tofu to one side.</li>
<li>Now you can start on your curry sauce.</li>
<li>In a pestle and mortar, grind together the cumin seeds, peppercorns and the black seeds from inside the cardamom pods.</li>
<li>In a large non-stick pan over a medium heat, add the oil.</li>
<li>Let the oil heat up and then add the ground spices, followed by the ginger, chilli and cabbage. Season the cabbage with salt.</li>
<li>Stir frequently to ensure the mixture doesn't stick to the pan. It will become very fragrant as the cabbage softens and becomes translucent.</li>
<li>To create a smooth sauce, add the softened spiced cabbage to a blender, along with the drained cashews, bell pepper halves and crushed tomatoes. Pulse the ingredients until you have a smooth curry base.</li>
<li>Return the curry base to the non-stick pan along with the tofu chunks. Taste and add salt if needed. Garnish with coriander/cilantro and serve hot with rice or roti (or both!)</li>
</ol>
