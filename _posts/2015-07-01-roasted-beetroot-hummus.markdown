ingredients: >
  1 15oz can chickpeas
  1 small beetroot
  Juice of 1 lemon
  Sea salt and cracked black pepper
  2 tbsp tahini
  1/4 cup olive oil
  
method: >
  Roast the beetroot
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat your oven to 375F or 190C.</li>
  <li>Remove the steam and roots from your beet. Wash and scrub the beet under the tap and peel it.</li>
  <li>Cut the beetroot into smaller chunks - 6 or so - and lay on a lined baking tray.</li>
  <li>Drizzle with olive oil and roast for 15-20 minutes until the beet is tender.</li>
  </ol>
  Make the hummus
  <ol>
  <li>While the beet roasts, measure out the remaining ingredients into your food processor.</li>
  <li>Once the beet is cooked, allow it to cool for 5-10 minutes before adding to the food processor and pulse until thoroughly combined with the other ingredients. If it seems too thick, you may add 1-2 tbsp of water.</li>
  <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary, adding lemon juice, salt or pepper.</li>
  <li>Garnish with a drop of olive oil and fresh herbs.</li>
  <li>Serve with pita chips and/or crudit√©s</li>
  </ol>

<p>Beets are just coming into their best at this time of year. They add a ton of nutrients to an already protein-rich dish like hummus: vitamins, antioxidants, dietary fibre and minerals.</p>
<p>Roasting the beet is the only time-consuming element to this. After that, just throw everything into a food processor. The hummus will keep for up to 5 days in the refrigerator.</p>
