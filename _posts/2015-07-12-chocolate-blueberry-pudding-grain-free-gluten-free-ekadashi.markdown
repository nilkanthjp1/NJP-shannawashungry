<div class="ERSSectionHead">This is an elegant little pudding for any occasion. It’s very rich and chocolatey and the soft, baked blueberries contrast it perfectly. It uses wholesome ingredients and is quick to put together.</div>

<div class="ERSSectionHead">If you don’t need it to be grain-free, feel free to use all purpose flour instead of buckwheat. I like the texture and flavour that the almond and coconut bring but you can use just one of them if you like.</div>
