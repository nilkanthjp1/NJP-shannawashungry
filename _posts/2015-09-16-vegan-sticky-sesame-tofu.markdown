<p>This tofu is the perfect accompaniment to stir fried rice or noodles. Sticky, sweet and slightly sour, you’ll be making it again and again.</p>
<p>The secret to crispy tofu is cubing it well in advance – it has to dry out as much as possible before you cook it or it’ll just be a bit squidgy and unpleasant. I also believe that drier tofu soaks up more flavour so you don’t feel the need to keep dousing it in seasoning.</p>
<p>I hope you’ll love this recipe as much as I do.</p>

{% capture ingredients %}
1 block of tofu
oil for greasing tray
1 tbsp sesame oil
3 tbsp golden syrup or honey (for non-vegans)
2 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
2 tsp sesame seeds
1 tsp red chilli flakes
{% endcapture %}
{% capture method %}
<ol>
<li>A minimum of 2 hours before you want to cook the tofu, cube the block of tofu into half inch cubes and set aside to drain in a large sieve.</li>
<li>Preheat your grill/broiler.</li>
<li>On a greased baking tray, lay out the tofu and place under the grill for approximately 7 minutes or until golden.</li>
<li>Remove the tray, toss the tofu to expose another side and grill for a further 7 minutes.</li>
<li>Heat a non-stick pan over a medium heat, and add the tofu along with a tbsp of sesame oil.</li>
<li>Add the soy sauce, vinegar and syrup. Stir gently to stop the mixture sticking to the bottom. It should be bubbling gently.</li>
<li>Add the sesame seeds and chilli and cook for another minute.</li>
<li>Taste the tofu and adjust seasonings as you see fit - you may prefer it spicier or sweeter.</li>
<li>Devour.</li>
</ol>
