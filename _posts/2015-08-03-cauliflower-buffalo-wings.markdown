ingredients: >
  1 head of cauliflower
  
  1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk (for non-vegans, dairy milk and buttermilk work too) 
  
  1/4 cup water
  
  1/2 cup all-purpose flour
  
  1/4 cup chickpea flour (gram flour)
  
  1 tsp cumin seeds, toasted and ground
  
  1 tsp of paprika
  
  1/4 tsp sea salt
  
  1/4 tsp cracked black pepper
  
  
  For the buffalo coating:
  
  2 tbsp vegan butter (or dairy butter)
  
  1/2 - 3/4 cup hot sauce (depending on how spicy you would like it to be)
   
  1 tsp brown sugar
  
  1 tsp soy sauce or liquid aminos
method: >
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat your oven to 425F or 220 degrees Celsius.</li>
  <li>Line a large baking tray with parchment paper (cooking spray won't work, it has to be parchment paper or a silpat mat)</li>
  <li>Wash the cauliflower and cut into medium sized florets.</li>
  <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flours, water and milk.</li>
  <li>Season the batter with the salt, pepper, toasted cumin and paprika.</li>
  <li>One by one, dip each floret into the batter, let the excess batter drip back into the bowl, and place on baking sheet.</li>
  <li>Get rid of excess batter and then keep the bowl aside for the coating.</li>
  <li>Once all your cauliflower has been battered, bake for 12 minutes, flip them, then bake for 12 more.</li>
  <li>While the cauliflower bakes, prepare the buffalo coating. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over a low heat and the hot sauce, soy sauce and sugar.</li>
  <li>Once it begins to simmer, take it off the heat. Pour the mixture into the mixing bowl you kept aside.</li>
  <li>Add the baked cauliflower to the mixing bowl and toss to coat evenly.</li>
  <li>Once coated, transfer the florets back to the baking sheet and bake for a further 25 minutes, flipping them half way through.</li>
  <li>Serve the 'wings' warm with mayonnaise or ranch dip.</li>
  </ol>

<p>These ‘wings’ are flavourful, wholesome and addictive. They make for a great appetiser or snack and most of these ingredients will already be in your pantry. For those who are sworn enemies of cauliflower, I challenge you to try them – after 50 minutes in a very hot oven, you can hardly tell it’s cauliflower at all.</p>
