ingredients: >
  5 tbsp butter
  2 1/4 cups all purpose flour
  1/3 tsp baking powder
  1/3 tsp baking soda
  1/4 cup brown rice syrup
  1/4 cup + 1 tbsp light brown sugar
  1/4 tsp salt 
  1 egg's worth of egg substitute (I used EnerG egg replacer)
  60g dark chocolate, roughly chopped (I highly recommend 85% cocoa solids, but 70% would work too)
  60g pecans, toasted and chopped
  A pinch of sea salt flakes/fleur de sel for sprinkling.
method: >
  <ol>
  <li>Melt the butter.</li>
  <li>Measure out the dry ingredients into a bowl.</li>
  <li>Pour in the melted butter and mix through.</li>
  <li>Add the egg substitute and your mix should begin to form a dough. (If your mix is too wet, add a tablespoon of flour. Do so again if necessary.)</li>
  <li>Fold in the chocolate and pecans.</li>
  <li>Form your dough into cookies, making sure they're evenly sized.</li>
  <li>Refrigerate the dough for a minimum of 2 hours in an airtight container, ensuring they don't stick to one another. If you have the time, overnight refrigeration is ideal.</li>
  <li>When you're ready to bake, preheat your oven to 400F.</li>
  <li>Remove the dough from the fridge for 10 minutes before baking</li>
  <li>Place the dough on a tray, leaving 2 inches between each one.</li>
  <li>Sprinkle with the salt flakes.</li>
  <li>Bake for 8-10 mins (8 for smaller cookies and 10 for medium).</li>
  <li>Let the cookies cool slightly on the baking tray before transferring them to a wire rack.</li>
  <li>Gobble. Incidentally, the raw dough also freezes wonderfully, so you may want to double (or treble) the recipe and save a few for a rainy day.</li>
  </ol>

<p>I’ve been trying to master the ultimate chocolate chip cookie for a while now. This has meant several trials and taste testing (research, of course) and I think I might just be getting somewhere. Some things I’ve learned along the way: always chill your dough before baking, always use good quality chocolate and always pair your chocolate with some sea salt. Those two guys are best friends, don’t keep ’em apart.</p>
<p>For me, these cookies are it.</p>
<p>They are beautifully soft in the middle.</p>
<p>They are loaded with seriously bittersweet chunks (NOT chips) of good quality chocolate.</p>
<p>They are studded with pecans that complement that chocolate perfectly.</p>
<p>They are flecked with sea salt that brings out the taste of chocolate like nothing else will.</p>
<p>They are egg free and aside from the sugar in the chocolate itself, refined sugar free.</p>
<p>You may think a yield of 6-7 cookies is a bit paltry. Well, friends, that’s because a larger yield has a habit of disappearing just as quickly as a small one in this house. So I had to halve it. No self control. Oh well. They’re worth every bite.</p>
<p>Yield: 6-7 medium sized cookies or 10 small.</p>
