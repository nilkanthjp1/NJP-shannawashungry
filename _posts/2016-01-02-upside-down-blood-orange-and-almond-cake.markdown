ingredients: >
  For the upside down magic:
  3 small blood oranges (or 2 medium blood oranges)
  3 tbsp butter
  1/3 cup light brown sugar 
  2 tsp fresh lemon juice
  
  For the cake:
  1 ¼ cup all purpose flour
  ½ cup almond meal
  ½ cup extra-fine granulated sugar or caster sugar
  2 tsp baking powder
  ½ tsp baking soda
  ¼ tsp salt
  1 tsp almond extract
  The zest of 2 blood oranges
  3 tbsp golden syrup (you can substitute honey if you wish)
  1 tbsp vinegar
  1 cup buttermilk
  ¼ cup tepid water
  ½ cup canola or sunflower oil
  
method: >
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat your oven to 180 degrees celsius or 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
  <li>Line an 8 inch cake tin with baking parchment.</li>
  <li>Using a very fine grater, remove the zest from your blood oranges and set it aside - you'll need about 2 tsp of zest.</li>
  <li>Slice the tops and bottoms off the oranges. Lay them on a flat surface and gently slice away the skin around the oranges.</li>
  <li>Slice rounds of around ¼ inch in thickness - you'll have approximately 10 slices of orange.</li>
  <li>In a small sauce pan, melt the brown sugar and butter. Add the lemon juice and let it warm for approximately 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Transfer the brown sugar mixture to the bottom of the cake pan and spread it out as evenly as possible.</li>
  <li>Cover the brown sugar mixture with the slices of orange in one single even layer.</li>
  <li>To make the cake, sieve the flour into a large mixing bowl. Follow with the almond meal, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Whisk the dry ingredients together.</li>
  <li>Add the liquid ingredients and stir until you have a smooth cake batter.</li>
  <li>Pour the cake mix over the blood oranges.</li>
  <li>Gently tap the cake tin onto your kitchen counter to remove any air bubbles (this will allow an even rise)</li>
  <li>Bake the cake for approximately 35 minutes - until the top is golden brown, perhaps slightly cracked and if gently pressed, the top bounces back.</li>
  <li>Let the cake cool in the tin for ten minutes.</li>
  <li>Run a knife around the edge of the cake to ease removal.</li>
  <li>Place a plate upside down on top of the cake tin. Gripping the tin and plate together, flip over to allow the cake to sit on the plate. Remove the cake tin to reveal your 'upside down' blood orange and almond masterpiece.</li>
  <li>The times recommended cooling the cake totally before serving - I ate it warm, pretty much as soon as I turned it out - no complaints from me.</li>
  </ol>

<p>This cake is so spectacular – it looks beautiful and tastes even better. Blood oranges can generally only be found at this time of year so if you spot them, grab them and make this cake! You will not regret it.</p>
<p>This recipe was adapted from a New York Times <a href="http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014488-upside-down-blood-orange-cake">recipe</a> – I decided to add almond meal and extract for a little something extra in terms of flavour and texture. Enjoy!</p>
