I mean come on! Chocolate chip cookies sans butter?! Before this recipe, I would have called that sacrilege. Turns out it’s a winner! These cookies are slightly crisp at the edge and soft and chewy at the centre. They have the subtlest hint of coconut running through them and need I go on about the merits of salty and sweet in a cookie? Salted popcorn + semi-sweet chocolate are long lost lovers, I’m sure of it.</p>
<p>Best of all, this recipe is 100% vegan (not that you can tell). Just be sure to use vegan chocolate chips – they’re easily found at Whole Foods and this useful guide by <a href="http://www.peta.org/living/food/definitive-guide-vegan-chocolate/">PETA</a> offers other options.</p>
<p>I know it seems a pain, but chilling this cookie dough before baking is not optional. Coconut oil has a different consistency to butter so it <em>must</em> chill before it gets baked. The results are totally worth it, I promise!</p>
<p>Happy baking xo</p>

{% capture method %}
<ol>
<li>In a mixing bowl, measure out the flour, sugars, salt, baking powder and baking soda.</li>
<li>Add the pureed tofu and coconut. Stir until you have a crumbly, sand-like dough.</li>
<li>Add 1 tbsp of the almond milk and combine. Only add a second if you feel the dough is excessively dry.</li>
<li>Fold in the popcorn with a spatula.</li>
<li>Fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
<li>Shape the dough into balls of equal size.</li>
<li>Place the dough balls on a lined baking tray, cover with cling film and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, but up to two days.</li>
<li>When you're ready to bake, preheat your oven to 350F or 180C.</li>
<li>Place the cookies on a lined baking tray and space them 2 inches apart.</li>
<li>Bake for 10-12 minutes until the edges are slightly golden. The centres will still be soft.</li>
<li>Let the cookies cool on the baking tray for 10 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
<li>The cookies will keep in an airtight container for up to 5 days.</li>
</ol>
