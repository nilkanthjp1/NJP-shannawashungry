<p>Cinnamon rolls (mmm). Little cinnamon rolls (aww). Little heart-shaped cinnamon rolls with a maple glaze (yeahhs).</p>
<p>These rolls are simple to make and with a slight variation in rolling technique, the classic spirals of dough transform into adorable hearts. They add some novelty and are rather yummy if I do say so myself.</p>
<p>May I also suggest that one day you replace the cinnamon filling with Nutella? You will not regret it!</p>
<p>Bonne Baking! xo</p>
<p>Yield: makes 20 miniature rolls</p>
{% capture ingredients %}
For the dough:

1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tbsp granulated sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1 1/4 tsp active dry yeast
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup milk
1 tbsp + 1 tsp unsalted butter

For the filling:

1 tbsp + 1 tsp unsalted butter, softened to room temperature (it needs to be spreadable)
1.5 tsp ground cinnamon
¼ cup brown sugar 

For the glaze:
2 tbsp powdered sugar
1/2 tsp maple syrup
1 1/4 tsp milk
{% endcapture %}
{% capture method %}
<ol>
<li>Measure out the dry ingredients into a bowl.</li>
<li>Heat your milk and water to approximately 115F. The warmth is necessary to activate the yeast. Avoid scalding water, is this will kill the yeast.</li>
<li>Stir the milk, water and melted butter into the flour mixture.</li>
<li>Combine until you have a soft dough.</li>
<li>It should have an elastic feel to it and come away clean from the sides of the bowl.</li>
<li>Knead your dough for 3 minutes on a floured surface.</li>
<li>Divide the dough into 2 balls.</li>
<li>Place the dough balls in a bowl, cover and leave to one side for 10 minutes.</li>
<li>In the mean time, make your filling. Combine the cinnamon and sugar in a bowl.</li>
<li>Line 2 baking trays with parchment.</li>
<li>After ten minutes, roll out one dough ball on a floured surface to a rectangle approximately 9x11 inches.</li>
<li>Warm your coconut oil if it’s solid, and spread half of it onto the dough.</li>
<li>Sprinkle half of the sugar and cinnamon mixture evenly across the dough.</li>
<li>Using a pizza slicer cut the edges of your dough so that you're left with an even rectangle. This will ensure your hearts are even.</li>
<li>Roll the longer sides of the rectangle towards each other carefully.</li>
<li>Stop when both sides meet in the middle.</li>
<li>Dab a drop of water in between where the two coils meet and press the sides together gently.</li>
<li>Cut the dough into ten evenly sized rolls, using the pizza slicer.</li>
<li>To make the heart shape, simply pinch the bottom of the roll into a point.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 11-19 with the second dough ball.</li>
<li>Place the 20 hearts on the 2 baking trays, leaving 3 inches between each one. Cover loosely with foil or cling film and leave the rolls to rest for at least 60 minutes in a warm place. They should swell slightly.</li>
<li>Preheat your oven to 356F or 180C.</li>
<li>Bake for 15-17 minutes, until the undersides are golden brown.</li>
<li>Remove from the oven and let the rolls cool on the tray.</li>
<li>Make the glaze by combining the three ingredients.</li>
<li>Once your rolls have cooled, drizzle the glaze over each one.</li>
<li>Devour.</li>
</ol>
