ingredients: >
  For the coconut sponge: 
  
  1 3/4 cup self-raising flour
  1/2 cup caster sugar or extra-fine granulated sugar
  1 1/2 tsp baking powder 
  1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda / baking soda
  1/4 tsp salt
  3 tbsp golden syrup
  3/4 + 2 tbsp warm milk 
  1 tbsp vinegar
  1/2 cup sunflower oil 
  1/4 cup desiccated coconut
  
  For the filling: 
  4 passion fruits
  150g mascarpone 
  150g fromage frais*
  1 tbsp caster sugar / extra-fine granulated sugar
  1/2 tsp vanilla bean paste
  
  
  *I haven't found fromage frais in US supermarkets, although it may well be available. I would suggest substituting low fat cream cheese or non-fat greek yogurt if you can't find it. 
method: >
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat your oven to 180C or 350F.</li>
  <li>Line your two 8 inch cake tins with baking parchment.</li>
  <li>In a mixing bowl, sift the dry ingredients <strong>in the following order</strong>: sugar, flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, coconut</li>
  <li>Add the golden syrup but avoid placing it on the baking powder and baking soda. If you haven't already, warm the milk.</li>
  <li>Add the vinegar directly onto the baking powder and soda. The ingredients will react and you’ll see lots of bubbles. This is exactly what you’re looking for.</li>
  <li>In quick succession, add the milk and oil.</li>
  <li>Mix the ingredients together until smooth. Beat for a further two minutes.</li>
  <li>Divide the cake batter evenly between the two cake tins.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the cake batter is evenly spread in the tins, so that they bake evenly.</li>
  <li>Bake for 20 minutes, until the sponges are golden. If you press the top of the sponge gently it ought to bounce back up. Alternatively, pierce with a skewer. If it comes out clean, the sponge is cooked all the way through.</li>
  <li>Let the sponges sit for 10 minutes before removing them from their tins. This will accelerate the cooling time. They <em>must</em> be at room temperature when you assemble the cake. If you aren't in a hurry, let them cool in the baking tins for 2-3 hours.</li>
  <li>When you're ready to assemble, combine the mascarpone, sugar, fromage frais and vanilla bean paste.</li>
  <li>Halve one passion fruit and add it's flesh to the mascarpone mixture.</li>
  <li>Halve the rest of the passion fruits and empty out the flesh and juice into a small bowl. Decide which sponge cake will be your bottom layer. Spoon approximately 5 tsp of the passionfruit juice onto the top of your bottom layer.</li>
  <li>Spoon the mascarpone mixture onto the centre of your cake, leaving the outer 1.5 inches untouched - the mixture will spread outwards when you place the other sponge on top.</li>
  <li>Now add the remaining passion fruit flesh onto the mascarpone mixture. Let this come to the edge of the cake, it looks so beautiful.</li>
  <li>Place the top layer of the cake carefully so that they are in line with one another.</li>
  <li>Refrigerate your cake. Remove from the fridge 10 minutes before serving.</li>
  <li>Dust with icing sugar just before serving.</li>
  </ol>

<p>I made this cake recently for my cousin’s birthday. It was the first time I combined these two flavours and they are a match made in heaven! The coconut sponge sandwiches a vanilla bean mascarpone and passion fruit. The sharp tang of the fruit is perfect with the creamy vanilla mascarpone.</p>
<p>This cake is great for a special occasion — unusual flavours, simple to make and very eye-catching.</p>
<p>You will need two 8 inch cake tins for this recipe.</p>
