ingredients: >
  Makes 6 medium sized scones or 9 small scones
  
  1 ½ cups self raising flour
  3 ½ tbsp (50g) cold butter, cubed
  ¼ tsp salt
  ½ cup buttermilk 
  2 tbsp sugar 
  ½ cup fresh blueberries
  ¼ tsp ground cinnamon
  1-2 tbsp buttermilk, to glaze
  1 tbsp turbinado or demerera sugar (optional)
  
method: >
  <ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 400F or 200C.</li>
  <li>Line a baking tray with parchment.</li>
  <li>Add the flour, butter and salt to a food processor.</li>
  <li>Pulse until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
  <li>Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and add the sugar, blueberries and cinnamon.</li>
  <li>Pour half of the buttermilk into the bowl and use a knife to quickly bring the mixture together.</li>
  <li>Add the remaining buttermilk and stir again to form a soft dough.</li>
  <li>On a lightly floured surface, very gently knead the dough for 20-30 seconds. It is crucial not to overwork the dough; you just want it to be a smooth ball.</li>
  <li>Gently roll the dough to a 2cm thickness. Using a round cookie cutter cut out the scones (a 6cm cutter will give you 6 scones, a 3-4cm cutter, 9).</li>
  <li>Lay the scones out on the baking tray, leaving 2 inches between each scone.</li>
  <li>Brush each scone with the buttermilk glaze (this is essential - it will ensure the scones are perfectly golden). At this point, you may sprinkle the top of each scone with the turbinado/demerera sugar.</li>
  <li>Bake for 15 minutes until golden brown.</li>
  <li>Serve warm with grass-fed butter.</li>
  </ol>

<p>This is likely the easiest scone recipe you’ll find, enhanced by blueberries and a touch of cinnamon. You could keep them plain if you like, or add something else to add interest – fresh raspberries, orange zest, vanilla beans.</p>
<p>Buttermilk is the key here, by the way. Fluffiest, puffiest, lightest, goldenest scones ever.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
