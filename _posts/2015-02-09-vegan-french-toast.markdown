ingredients: >
  4 slices sourdough bread
  1/2 mashed banana
  1 tsp ground cinnamon
  1/2 cup unsweetened vanilla almond milk
  A pinch of ground nutmeg
  A pinch of salt
  1 tbsp all purpose flour
  
  Coconut oil for frying
  1 cup blueberries to serve.
method: >
  <ol>
  <li>Whisk together the banana, almond milk, spices, salt and flour.</li>
  <li>Dip a slice of bread into the mixture. Flip it over to coat it fully.</li>
  <li>Heat a tsp of coconut oil on a griddle pan over a medium high heat.</li>
  <li>Once the pan is hot, place the slice of bread onto the melted coconut oil and cook until golden on both sides.</li>
  <li>Repeat with the remaining slices.</li>
  <li>For the stewed blueberries, simply cook the blueberries in a small non-stick saucepan over a low heat until they burst and release their juices. Toss the pan every few minutes to ensure the blueberries don't stick. For a runnier syrup, add one tablespoon of water to the saucepan and cook for approximately 5 minutes until the fruit juices come to a boil.</li>
  <li>Serve the toast with lashings of maple syrup, the blueberries and maybe some powdered sugar and extra cinnamon powder.</li>
  </ol>

</a>This is a weekend breakfast staple. Sure, sometimes you wanna eat pancakes. Sometimes something savoury. But at other times you really just want some vegan sourdough french toast with stewed blueberries. AMIRITE?<br/>
I don’t use any refined sugar in this recipe either so there’s my vague nod to healthy and wholesome checked. Oh, and there’s some fruit to eat alongside it.</p>
<p>In all fairness, sourdough isn’t absolutely essential but I do think it adds to the overall texture and flavour of the toast. Regular sliced bread is squidgier, sourdough holds its own much better.</p>
<p>Serves 2.</p>
