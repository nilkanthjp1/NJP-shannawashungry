ingredients: >

  1/4 cup uncooked quinoa
  1/4 cup chopped pecans

method: >
  <ol>
  <li class="p1">Preheat your oven to 350F/180C and line a baking tray with parchment.
  Combine all the dry ingredients EXCEPT the dried fruit in a mixing bowl.</li>
  <li class="p1">Add the syrup and melted oil and stir thoroughly.</li>
  <li class="p1">Spread the mixture onto your lined baking tray. Keep it at the centre of the tray rather than spreading it too thin - it will burn easily if you do this.</li>
  <li class="p1">Bake for 7 minutes, then stir the mixture to ensure even baking.</li>
  <li class="p1">Bake for a further 8 minutes until golden brown.</li>
  <li class="p1">Let the mixture cool on the tray. You may have to break the mixture up into smaller clusters, it really depends on your preference.</li>
  <li class="p1">If using, add the dried fruit to your quinola.</li>
  <li class="p1">Enjoy!</li>

<p>This recipe is perfect if you’re looking for a protein-rich and filling breakfast option. It also happens to be totally grain-free and therefore ideal for paleo diets and ekadashi.</p>
<p>It is simple to put together and freezes well, so why not make a big batch and take out a small serving as and when you need it?</p>
<p>The recipe is pretty versatile so you could substitute other ingredients quite easily. For example, you could also use sesame seeds, walnuts, or dried apricots. Make it your own!</p>
<p>I suggest serving the quinola with fresh fruit, Greek yogurt and toasted coconut flakes.</p>
