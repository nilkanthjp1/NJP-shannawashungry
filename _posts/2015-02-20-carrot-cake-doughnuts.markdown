<p>Oh, I love me some doughnuts. All the doughnuts are my friends. That said, deep-fried dough on the reg probably isn’t advisable so this baked carrot cake variety is a winner. The recipe is adapted from <a href="http://www.sainsburysmagazine.co.uk/">Sainsbury’s Magazine</a>.</p>
<p>Because they aren’t fried or yeasted like authentic doughnuts, they have a more cake-like structure. However, they are just as yummy! And <em>ever</em> so slightly less sinful. These doughnuts are laden with spices, the walnuts and carrots offer texture and the slightly tart cream cheese frosting is a perfect accompaniment.<br/>

<p>You will need a doughnut pan for this recipe.</p>

For the doughnuts: 
75ml buttermilk* 
45g coconut oil
75g all purpose or whole wheat flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp ground ginger
½ tsp grated nutmeg
a pinch of salt
45g caster sugar or extra fine granulated sugar
2 tbsp maple syrup
1 egg's worth of egg substitute (I used EnerG egg replacer and used as directed)
75g carrot, finely grated
25g walnut pieces, chopped

*or 75ml of milk with 2 tsp of lemon juice and left for 10 minutes before use

50g cream cheese, at room temperature
15g unsalted butter, softened
40g powdered/icing sugar
2 tsp maple syrup
1 tbsp lemon juice
{% endcapture %}
{% capture method %}
<h1></h1>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 356F or 180C.</li>
<li>Grease your doughnut pan.</li>
<li>Measure out the flour, spices, baking powder and salt to a mixing bowl.</li>
<li>Melt the coconut oil and add to it the maple syrup and sugar.</li>
<li>Prepare your egg substitute and add it to the dry ingredients.</li>
<li>Add the coconut oil mixture to the mixing bowl, along with the carrots and buttermilk.</li>
<li>Combine the ingredients but avoid stirring excessively. Once it's a smooth batter, you can stop.</li>
<li>Using a piping bag (or a Ziploc sandwich bag), pipe the batter into the doughnut pan.  (Put the piping bag into a large mug and fold it over the edges of the mug. Fill the bag to the top of the mug and then remove).</li>
<li>For a 12 cavity mini doughnut pan, bake for 8 minutes. For a 6 cavity doughnut pan, bake for 10-12 minutes. If you gently press a doughnut, it should bounce back up if cooked.</li>
<li>Once cooked, remove from the oven. After 5 minutes, transfer to a wire rack to cool. Turn them out so that the underside of the doughnuts are facing up. This is the side you will want to frost.</li>
<li>While they cool, prepare your frosting. In a small bowl, whisk together all the ingredients.</li>
<li>Once the doughnuts are cool, frost.</li>
</ol>
