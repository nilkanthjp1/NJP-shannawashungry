So clever and swirly. It never fails to bring a smile to my face when I cut into it and see them ripples. The most important thing with a cake of such beauty, though, is to make sure it tastes as good as it looks. Rather than keep the white cake batter plain or vanilla, I flavour mine with fresh orange zest or mashed banana. Orange and chocolate or banana and chocolate? Infinitely more interesting than just plain ol’ vanilla (sorry vanilla).</p>
<p class="p1">I hope you give this cake a try, it never disappoints.</p>
<p>P.S. I used an organic Cara Cara orange for this cake and it worked so wonderfully. The Cara Cara has a lovely coral flesh and a less intense citrus taste. It’s super sweet and I highly recommend it for baking and just to EAT. So scrummy.  I found them at Whole Foods.</p>
<p>Bonne Baking! xo</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  For the cake: 
2 1/4 cups self raising flour 3/4 cup caster sugar or extra fine granulated sugar 2 1/4 tsp baking powder 3/4 tsp baking soda/bicarbonate of soda 1/3 tsp salt 1 1/2 tbsp apple cider vinegar 3/4 cup sunflower oil 4 1/2 tbsp brown rice syrup or golden syrup 1 cup warm milk + 1/4 cup  1/4 cup cocoa Zest of 1 orange 
For the icing:
8oz icing sugar 2oz butter 1 tbsp water 1 tbsp cocoa 1 tbsp milk

  <h2>Method</h2>
  <h3>Make your cake:</h3> <ol> <li class="p1">Line your 8in cake tin with baking parchment and preheat your oven to 356F or 180C.</li> <li class="p1">Sieve the dry ingredients into a bowl in the following order: flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, baking soda.</li> <li class="p1">Add the syrup but avoid pouring it onto the baking powder and soda.</li> <li class="p1">Add the vinegar directly onto the baking powder and soda. The ingredients will react and you'll see lots of bubbles. This is exactly what you're looking for.</li> <li class="p1">In quick succession, add 1 cup milk and the oil.</li> <li class="p1">Mix the ingredients thoroughly until it is a smooth batter.</li> <li class="p1">In a second bowl, sieve 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa.</li> <li class="p1">Pour just under half of the mix into the second bowl along with the remainder of the milk. Mix well until you have a smooth chocolate batter.</li> <li class="p1">Add the grated orange zest into the white batter.</li> <li class="p1">Now the fun part begins! Pour one large spoon/ladleful of white batter into the centre of the cake tin. Using another large spoon, place a spoonful of chocolate batter into the centre of the white batter. Keep on going, alternating spoons of each mix until you've used them both up.</li> <li class="p1">Place the tin in the oven and bake for 30 minutes.</li> <li class="p1">After 30 minutes, tear a piece of foil that would cover the cake tin, swiftly and gently open the oven door and cover the cake with the foil. This will allow it to cook without browning too much on top.</li> <li class="p1">Bake for a further 5 minutes. Pierce the the cake with a skewer. If it comes out clean it is cooked all the way through and you may remove it from the oven.</li> <li class="p1">Let the cake cool for at least an hour in the tin. It must be cool when you ice it. If you're in a hurry, let it cool for at least 30 minutes in the tin before removing it to accelerate cooling.</li> </ol> <h3>Make your icing:</h3> Use a double boiler if you have one. If you don't, no problem. A double boiler basically consists of a bowl placed on top of a pan of simmering water. The bowl must not touch the water, but creates a seal with the bottom pan to trap the steam produced by the simmering water. <ol> <li class="p1">Sieve icing/powdered sugar into a bowl that can be heated on a stove top.</li> <li class="p1">Add in the remaining ingredients.</li> <li class="p1">Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water, ensuring the bowl doesn't touch the water.</li> <li class="p1">Use a low-medium heat setting. If the pan gets too hot, the ingredients will become grainy rather than smooth.</li> <li class="p1">The chocolate icing will come together gradually as the butter melts. Stir occasionally to combine.</li> <li class="p1">Once you have a smooth chocolate icing, switch off the stove and remove the bowl from the heat. Allow the icing to cool for at least 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. You want the icing to thicken enough so that you can ice the cake with ease.</li> <li class="p1">Ice your cake! Use a knife without a serrated edge for a smoother finish.</li> </ol>
