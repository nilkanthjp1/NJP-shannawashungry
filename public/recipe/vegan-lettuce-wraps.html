    <p>So the method for this recipe looks deceivingly long and complex – it really isn’t. The key things to do are to <strong>cut and drain your tofu</strong> <em>way</em> before you want to cook it. If it’s watery it won’t crisp up and absorb the flavour of the soy sauce.</p>
<p>Other than that, it’s a piece of cake! The lettuce is the perfect accompaniment to these vibrant and flavourful noodles and ideal for dinner on a summer evening.</p>
<p>If you aren’t serving sweet and sour sauce with the meal, you may want to add a tbsp of brown sugar to the noodles to bring a richer flavour profile to the dish.</p>


  </div>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  Serves 2
1/2 block (7oz) of extra firm tofu (it will crisp up better than less firm tofu) 2 tbsp toasted sesame oil (you can use canola/sunflower if you don't have sesame) 1 tbsp fresh minced ginger 1/2 tbsp minced green chilli  1 cup shredded cabbage 2 cups assorted vegetables, fresh or frozen or a combination of both (I used corn, green beans, carrots, zucchini, peas) 1/2 cup water chestnuts, chopped 2 tbsp soy sauce 2 tbsp crushed peanuts
2 nests dry wheat noodles (approx 4 oz)
2 tbsp peanut butter Juice of 1 lime, and more to garnish  2 tbsp fresh chopped cilantro (coriander) to garnish
1 small head of lettuce, washed and separated into leaves

  <hr />
  <h2>Method</h2>
  <ol> <li>Using a food chopper (like the good ol' Vidalia) cut your slab of tofu into tiny cubes (approx 0.5cm cubes). You can, of course, do this by hand if you don't have a chopper. Let the tofu cubes drain in a sieve/strainer for a minimum of 2 hours.</li> <li>In a large saucepan, heat the sesame oil over a medium heat.</li> <li>Add the shredded cabbage, ginger and chilli to the oil and sauté for 5 minutes until the cabbage shreds begin to brown at the edges. It will soften and turn slightly translucent.</li> <li>Add the vegetables and sauté for a further 5-7 minutes.</li> <li>Add the chopped water chestnuts and crushed peanuts.</li> <li>Add the soy sauce and turn the heat down.</li> <li>Meanwhile, in a frying pan, heat 2 tbsp cooking oil over a medium heat.</li> <li>Add the tofu cubes to the frying pan and cook for 3-4 minutes on a medium-high heat. Add 2 tbsp of soy sauce over the tofu.</li> <li>Boil some water in a third pan - enough to submerge the noodles.</li> <li>Stir the tofu to ensure cooking on all sides. They will brown and crisp up quickly because of their size, so keep an eye on them! Once you're happy with the colour, switch off the heat.</li> <li>Submerge the noodles in a the pan of boiling water and cook. Depending on the type of noodle, this should not take more than 5 minutes.</li> <li>Once the noodles have cooked, cut the noodles into thirds - so they're easier to eat!</li> <li>Transfer the noodles to the vegetable mixture, add the lime juice and combine all the ingredients. Turn the heat up to medium-high.</li> <li>Add the peanut butter and stir until it has melted and coats the noodles.</li> <li>Have a taste. Add more lime juice/soy sauce as needed. Garnish with extra crushed peanuts and the cilantro/coriander.</li> <li>Serve with the tofu, lettuce leaves and sweet and sour sauce.</li> </ol>
