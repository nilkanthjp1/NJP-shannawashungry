    <p>I used lemon to flavour this coconut cake, but lime and coconut also work really well. Despite lots of shredded coconut, this cake remains light and fluffy thanks to the buttermilk. Unlike with most egg-free sponge recipes, using buttermilk keeps the sponge pale – I find that using regular milk browns the top of the cake too much.</p>
<p> </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  Cake:  1 ½ cups all purpose flour ½ cup cane sugar 1 ½ tsp baking powder ½ tsp baking soda  ¼ tsp salt  1 tbsp vinegar ½ cup shredded coconut ½ cup sunflower oil  1 cup buttermilk  ¼ cup water 3 tbsp golden syrup or maple syrup zest of one lemon or lime
Citrus frosting: 
2oz unsalted butter, at room temperature 2oz powdered (icing) sugar  6oz cream cheese, at room temperature (this is crucial) 2 tbsp freshly squeezed lime juice or lemon juice

  <hr />
  <h2>Method</h2>
  <ol> <li>Preheat your oven to 180C or 350F.</li> <li>Line a 9 inch cake tin with parchment paper.</li> <li>Sift the flour into a mixing bowl.</li> <li>Add the remaining dry ingredients.</li> <li>Add the shredded coconut, then follow with the liquids. Whisk together until you have a smooth cake batter. Add the zest of your lemon or lime.</li> <li>Pour the cake batter into your lined tin and bake for 27-30 minutes until golden. The top of the cake should bounce back if gently pressed and a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake should come out clean.</li> <li>Allow the cake to cool completely.</li> <li>When the cake is totally cool and ready to frost, be sure that your butter and cream cheese are at the <em>same</em> (room) temperature - if not, you might get lumps of cream cheese in the icing. Both cream cheese and butter will give in the same way when pressed gently if they're ready.</li> <li>Cream the powdered sugar and butter together until pale. With a hand whisk or whisk attachment in a stand mixer, this should take 2-3 minutes.  Add the cream cheese in, in thirds, allowing each bit to incorporate before adding the next.</li> <li>Add the citrus juice and whisk until the the mixture is smooth.</li> <li>Frost the cake as desired.</li> <li>Top with toasted coconut flakes.</li> </ol> &nbsp;
