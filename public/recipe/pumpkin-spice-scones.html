    <p>I hadn’t even heard of pumpkin scones until I moved to the USA. Last week (or was it the week before?), when Starbucks launched its ‘PSL’ (Pumpkin Spice Latte) and a host of autumnal treats, my friends were <em>so</em> excited.</p>
<p>I was envious. I had to know why pumpkin scones merit that level of joy. So obviously I made some. And now, friends, I understand the hype.</p>
<p>If you make these, you will too.</p>


  </div>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  Makes 6 large scones or 9 medium
1 ½ cups self-raising flour (if you only have all purpose flour, use that and add a tsp of baking powder)
3 ½ tbsp (50g) cold butter, cubed
¼ tsp salt
¼ cup buttermilk
¼ cup pumpkin puree 
4 tbsp sugar
1 tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp ground ginger
½ tsp ground nutmeg
3-4 tbsp buttermilk, to glaze
For the sweet glaze:
¼ cup powdered sugar
1 tsp milk
A sprinkle of ground cinnamon (optional)

  <hr />
  <h2>Method</h2>
  <ol> <li>Preheat your oven to 400F or 200C.</li> <li>Line a large baking tray with parchment.</li> <li>In a food processor, pulse together the flour, salt and butter. It will quickly resemble breadcrumbs. Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl.</li> <li>Add the sugar and spices and stir to combine.</li> <li>Create a well in the mixture and pour in the pumpkin puree and buttermilk.</li> <li>Bring mixture together with a fork. Once it is close to a dough, use your hands to work it gently into a smooth ball.</li> <li>Place the dough ball on a lightly floured surface. Sprinkle the top of the ball with a little flour and then roll out to a circle that is 3/4"-1 inch thick.</li> <li>Use a pizza cutter to divide the dough like you would a pizza: either 6 or 9 triangles.</li> <li>Transfer the scones to the baking tray, spacing 2 inches apart.</li> <li>Brush each scone with the buttermilk, then bake for 15-17 minutes until puffy and decidedly golden underneath.</li> <li>Once the scones have cooled totally, you can glaze them.</li> <li>Simply combine the sugar and milk (and cinnamon if using). It might not seem like that much milk will suffice but stir for at least a minute and you should have a drizzle-able glaze. If you don't, add a drop more milk.</li> <li>Drizzle a spoonful across each scone.</li> <li>Best enjoyed warm with coffee.</li> </ol>
