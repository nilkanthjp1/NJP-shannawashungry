    <p>I made this dish for the first time a week ago. I had absolutely no idea what to make for dinner and the only fresh produce I had in the fridge was butternut squash and parsley. Thanks to some rosemary and sage growing on our porch, the dish was off to a good start. It came together quite quickly because the method allows for multitasking.</p>
<p>You could also make this dish ahead of time and bake it right before serving.</p>


  </div>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  Serves 2:
12 jumbo pasta shells 12oz butternut squash, cubed 1 sprig rosemary, washed and torn Olive oil for roasting Sea salt and cracked black pepper 2 tbsp butter 2 tbsp all purpose flour 1 ½ cup milk ½ cup grated sharp cheddar cheese, plus more for sprinkling 2-3 tbsp grated Parmesan Handful of Italian parsley 

  <hr />
  <h2>Method</h2>
  <ol> <li class="p1">Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit or 190 degrees celsius.</li> <li class="p1">Add the cubed butternut squash to a baking tray and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the rosemary over the squash and drizzle with olive oil. Roast the squash for approximately 20 minutes until tender.</li> <li class="p1">While the squash is roasting, prepare the pasta: in a pan of boiling salted water, cook the shells for 8 minutes and then drain.</li> <li class="p1">Transfer the roasted squash to a food processor and pulse until the mixture is smooth. Taste and add more salt and pepper if necessary.</li> <li class="p1">Stuff each shell with the squash mixture and lay them out in your baking dish. I used an 8" square dish.</li> <li class="p1">For the parsley cream sauce, heat a non stick sauce pan over a medium heat.</li> <li class="p1">Add the butter and the flour to the pan and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.</li> <li class="p1">Add the milk to the pan and stir continuously until it starts to thicken and simmer.</li> <li class="p1">Once thickened, add the Parmesan and ½ cup of grated cheddar. Stir until you have a smooth and creamy sauce.</li> <li class="p1">Finely chop the parsley or pulse it in your food processor and it to the cream sauce.</li> <li class="p1">Pour the parsley cream over the shells, and then sprinkle more grated cheddar on top.</li> <li class="p1">In a shallow pan over a low heat, melt a nob of salted butter. Add the sage leaves and flash fry in the bubbling butter. They will cook very quickly so take them out the minute they're coated in butter and bubbling.</li> <li class="p1">Bake the whole dish for approximately 20 minutes until it is bubbling and golden brown on top.</li> </ol>
