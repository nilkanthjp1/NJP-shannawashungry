    <p>I’ve been wanting to make miniature hand pies for a while, for two reasons:</p>
<p>A) They are unashamedly adorable and inviting.</p>
<p>B) It’s just more practical to be able to make a few tiny pies rather than one big one that might not get finished. This way, you can make a few and bake them all if you like, or freeze a few raw ones for a future pie craving (is it just me who gets those?).</p>
<p>I went with a classic apple-cinnamon filling because it’s a real crowd pleaser. I would absolutely insist on using Granny Smith apples. The tartness that they contribute to the flavour profile is essential. The recipe for the pie crust dough is from the wonderful <a href="http://joythebaker.com/2014/11/five-tips-best-butter-pie-crust-scratch/">Joy the Baker</a>.</p>
<p>*I didn’t have buttermilk so I improvised: 1/4 tbsp of lemon juice in 1/4 cup of milk. Leave for 10 mins before using.</p>


  </div>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  Yield: makes 9 hand pies 
For the pie crust: 1/2 cup or 1 stick butter, grated 1 1/4 cup all purpose flour 1/2 tsp salt 1 tbsp sugar 1/4 cup buttermilk*

For the filling:  1/2 cup peeled and diced Granny Smith apple 1 tsp lemon juice 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon 1 tbsp brown sugar 1 tbsp all purpose flour 1/2 tbsp brown rice syrup Fleur de sel (optional)

To glaze: 1 tbsp milk

To top:  1 tbsp demerera sugar (optional)

  <h2>Method</h2>
  <h3>Make your pie crust dough:</h3> <ol> <li>Measure out flour, salt and sugar into a bowl and combine. You may want to use the bowl of your stand mixer if you don't want to knead your pastry dough by hand.</li> <li>Add the grated butter and use your fingers to incorporate the butter into the flour. Keep going until the mixture resembles sand, with very few lumps.</li> <li>At this point, make a well in the mixture and add the buttermilk. Either with a fork or with your stand mixer, bring the dough together and knead for 3-4 minutes or until you have a smooth ball of dough. I did use a stand mixer to bring the ingredients together but I would still recommend you knead by hand on a floured surface for a couple of minutes.</li> <li>Flatten your dough into a thick disc, wrap in cling film and refrigerate for an hour.</li> </ol> <h3>Make your filling:</h3> <ol> <li>Combine the filling ingredients in a bowl and mix well.</li> </ol> <h3>Make your pies:</h3> <ol> <li>Preheat your oven to 400F and remove dough from the fridge.</li> <li>Line a baking tray with parchment paper.</li> <li>On a well-floured surface, roll out your dough to a 1/8in thickness.</li> <li>Using a 2.5in round cookie cutter, cut out 18 discs. Cut out as many as you can before re-rolling the cut offs.</li> <li>Lay out 9 discs on the baking tray.</li> <li>Place a tablespoon of your apple mixture in the middle of each disc.</li> <li>If using, sprinkle a few flakes of fleur de sel atop the pie filling.</li> <li>Cover the apple mixture with another disc.</li> <li>Pinch the pies closed with your fingertips and then seal with the tines of a fork. Be sure to seal them well!</li> <li>Using a sharp knife point or a skewer, poke 3-4 vent holes into the lid of each pie. This will ensure they don't burst while baking.</li> <li>Using a pastry brush, brush your pies with the milk. This will give them a lovely golden colour as they bake.</li> <li>If using, sprinkle the pies with the demerera sugar.</li> <li>Bake for 17 minutes or until golden brown and bubbling.</li> <li>Allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li> </ol>
