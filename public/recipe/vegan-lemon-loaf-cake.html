    <p>After a week in New Jersey, I’m back in England. And unlike New Jersey which saw snow just a few days ago, there are daffodils and blossom everywhere in London. This recipe is lovely for springtime; it is light, and full of zesty lemon.</p>
<p>This recipe is vegan, however you could substitute the nut milk for dairy milk if you prefer.</p>
<p>I decorated mine with caramelised lemon slices. If you’d like to do the same, simply slice a lemon finely with a mandolin, make a simple caramel and caramelise the lemon slices on each side for 15-20 seconds. Let them cool before topping the loaf cake.</p>
<p>Happy Baking!</p>


  </div>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  For the loaf cake: 1 3/4 cup self-raising flour 1/2 cup caster sugar or extra-fine granulated sugar 1/4 tsp salt 1 1/2 tsp baking powder  1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda / baking soda 1/4 cup desiccated coconut 3 tbsp brown rice syrup or golden syrup 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar 3/4 cup + 2 tbsp unsweetened almond milk 1/2 cup sunflower oil 

For the lemon glaze: 1/2 cup icing/powdered sugar Zest and juice of 1 small lemon or 1/2 a large lemon

  <h2>Method</h2>
  <ol> <li>Preheat your oven to 350F or 180C.</li> <li>Line your loaf tin with baking parchment.</li> <li>In a mixing bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer, sift the first 5 ingredients in the above order (flour to baking powder).</li> <li>Add the coconut and syrup.</li> <li>Add the vinegar, which will react with the bicarbonate of soda.</li> <li>Swiftly add the almond milk and oil.</li> <li>Mix the ingredients together until you have a smooth cake batter. If you feel it is too thick, you may add up to 2 more tbsp of milk.</li> <li>Pour the cake batter into the lined tin. Ensure it is spread evenly.</li> <li>Bake for 25 minutes.</li> <li>Tear a piece of foil large enough to cover the tin. Quickly and gently remove the cake from the oven and cover with the foil.</li> <li>Return to oven for a further 20 minutes.</li> <li>To be sure the cake has baked all the way through, pierce with a skewer. If it comes out clean, it's ready.</li> <li>Allow the cake to cool totally before icing.</li> <li>Make the icing by sifting the icing/powdered sugar and adding the juice and zest. Mix until smooth.</li> <li>Remove the cake from the tin.</li> <li>Using a piping bag* ice the cake as you wish. I like to just zigzag across repeatedly. *You could also just fill a ziploc bag with the icing, snip a tiny part of the corner off, and use that.</li> </ol>
