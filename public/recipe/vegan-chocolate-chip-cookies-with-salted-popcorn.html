I mean come on! Chocolate chip cookies sans butter?! Before this recipe, I would have called that sacrilege. Turns out it’s a winner! These cookies are slightly crisp at the edge and soft and chewy at the centre. They have the subtlest hint of coconut running through them and need I go on about the merits of salty and sweet in a cookie? Salted popcorn + semi-sweet chocolate are long lost lovers, I’m sure of it.</p>
<p>Best of all, this recipe is 100% vegan (not that you can tell). Just be sure to use vegan chocolate chips – they’re easily found at Whole Foods and this useful guide by <a href="http://www.peta.org/living/food/definitive-guide-vegan-chocolate/">PETA</a> offers other options.</p>
<p>I know it seems a pain, but chilling this cookie dough before baking is not optional. Coconut oil has a different consistency to butter so it <em>must</em> chill before it gets baked. The results are totally worth it, I promise!</p>
<p>Happy baking xo</p>
