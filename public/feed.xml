If you can relate, you came to the right place. These cookies are soft and chewy and studded with bittersweet chocolate. The coconut sings through from the coconut oil, sugar &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; shredded coconut so ‘you’re welcome’ coconut fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren’t exactly low in fat but they’re free of refined sugar if you use coconut sugar like I did, and they’re gluten-free and ekadashi-friendly (do I need to provide any more reasons to bake these? Didn’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

I actually used a combination of tofu and vegan chicken strips from &lt;a href=&quot;http://beyondmeat.com/&quot;&gt;Beyond Meat&lt;/a&gt;. I highly recommend both options – it really depends on what you might prefer/what you can get a hold of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few steps involved with this recipe but it comes together pretty quickly. As long as you get your tofu draining and your cashews soaking in good time, it won’t take long at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to adjust the spicing according to your personal taste – more green chilli, less cardamom etc. I didn’t actually use garam masala because it doesn’t agree with me but I feel like it would be rude not to include it, so there it is. I had some very (beginning-to-wrinkle) ripe grape tomatoes in the fridge and used those instead of crushed tomatoes. Basically, do what you want – fresh, canned, it’s all good and the results are all yum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The curry is very flavourful and creamy without using cream or coconut milk (both lovely, but high in saturated fats). In order to keep this dish lean and high in just protein, I decided to use cashews for creaminess and they’re very effective. If you’d rather use cream or coconut milk, I’m sure it’ll be just as delicious!&lt;/p&gt;
